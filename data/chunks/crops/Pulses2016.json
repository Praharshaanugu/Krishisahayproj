The greatest challenge to the agriculture in the years to come is to provide adequate food to burgeoning population in order to combat with hunger and malnutrition. We will have t o feed more people with scarce water resources, recurring droughts, degrading lands and difficult access to energy. The agricultural technologies need a shift from production oriented to profit oriented sustainable farming system. A shift in crop prefere nces by the farmers has been seen since the 1990s. Indo - Gangetic belt farmers who grew pulses earlier, have increasingly taken to wheat production where yields range from 3,000 to 4,000 kg per hectare compared to only about 800 kg in case of pulses. Over the past two decades the production of pulses has largely shifted from northern India to central and southern part. Today, 80% of total pulses production is realized in six states namely, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. Both area and productivity of chickpea significantly increased over decades. The Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for adult male and female is 60 g and 55 g per day. The per capita availability of pulses is @ 42 g per day. Pulses are chief source of vegetable protein in the human diet. The deficiency of protein in human diet often leads to Protein -Energy -Malnutrition (PEM) causing various forms of anemia. Besides, nutritive value of pulses in human diet, food legumes tend to fix at mospheric nitrogen to N - compounds to the tune of 72 to 350 kg per hectare per year and provide soil cover that helps to sustain soil health. India is the largest producer, 25% of world\u2019s production, and consumer 27% of total pulses of the",

Besides, nutritive value of pulses in human diet, food legumes tend to fix at mospheric nitrogen to N - compounds to the tune of 72 to 350 kg per hectare per year and provide soil cover that helps to sustain soil health. India is the largest producer, 25% of world\u2019s production, and consumer 27% of total pulses of the world. The dome stic production is often less than the estimated demand i.e. 23 - 24 million tons. Studies on consumption pattern has revealed that in India only 8 -10 million tons of pulses are used directly as a food item (Dal), the remaining 12 million tons being indirect actual consumption as processed/value added products such as snacks, fast food for domestic consumption and export. Thus the average gap of 05 MT is met through imports. In India, the share of pulses to gross cropped area and in total foodgrains basket is about 12 per cent and 6 -7 per cent respectively. India\u2019s outstanding contribution towards total global acreage and production of pulses at 35 per cent and 25 per cent respectively is credited to our strength. The three five year plans viz., Xth, XIth & XIIth (T.E.2014 -15) exhibited an increasing yield trends, the highest being 788 kg/ha during 2012 -13 as against the world\u2019s average productivity of 904 kg/ha, is less than the demonstrated potential under the frontline demonstrations. The targeted producti on and productivity is possible by way of harnessing this yield gap by growing pulses in new niches, precision farming, quality inputs, soil test based INM and mechanized method of pulse cultivation complimented with generous Governmental Policies and appr opriate funding support to implementing states/stake holders. In India, pulses have always received due attentions both in terms of requirement by consumers and adequate programmatic support from the government at the production front. Besides the game c hanging efforts under the \u2018Prime Minister\u2019s Krishi Sinchai Yojna\u2019 pulse production has received adequate importance. The IT initiatives in extension/apps to access market, Soil Health Cards, INM, crop advisories and E -NAM, involvement of KVKs in seed hub, additional breeder seed production, strengthening Bio -fertilizer/Bio -control production units and FPOs etc., are other specific efforts.

Creation of buffer stock, imposition of stock limits and offering pulses at low cost through mobile vans including enco uraging Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in food processing etc., are the other policy interventions. Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects Since Seventh Plan onwards, the NPDP (1985 -90 to 2003 -04) and ISOPOM (2004 -05 to 2010 -11) were the major CSS on Pulse Development in addition to NFSM -Pulses since Eleventh Plan. NSFM was lunched to increase the additional production of rice, wheat and pulses by 10, 08 and 02 million tons, respectively at the terminal year of XIth plan. 12th Five Year Plan aims at additional production targets of 25 million tons of food grains comprising rice, wheat, pulses and coarse cereals at 10, 08, 04 and 03 million tons respectively. Efforts through compilation, have been made to have an access to most of the FAQs on pulses development, plan effort\u2019s impacts, scenar io, strategies, post harvest and processing aspects along -with the production technology. The Status Paper also provides information on various agencies/stake holders, operating in isolation, may work in a participatory mode. This Publication is ine vitable and indispensable to highlight the past scenario, present status and the future prospects of this commodity in the country delineating the districts, as well. More emphasis has also been given on the proposed strategies beyond XIIth plan in the face of the National Nutritional Security. The strategies recommended would certainly cope with the limited and dwindling resources at hand. Various aspects of need -based pulse production and developmental programs associated, in line with the National Agricu ltural Policy, have been incorporated with their varying degrees of impacts during different areas. I hope, the Status Paper \u201cPulses in India : Retrospect and Prospects\u201d brought out by DPD, Bhopal would not only benefit the intelligentsia, the fa rmers, the developmental organizations, processors/traders and all the readers, but a sense of motivation may be imbibed to all concerned in making the country self -sufficient and self - reliant",

Tiwari) Director Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects ABOUT THE DIRECTORATES 1.0 The Directorate of Pulses Development (DPD), one of the eight Commodity Development Directorates (CDDs) (Jute, Cotton, Wheat, Millets, Rice, Sugarcane and Oilseeds) of the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmer s Welfare, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare (DAC&FW) was established at Lucknow (U.P.) in 1971 with the merger of Regional Extension Unit Ahmadabad (Gujarat). On the recommendations of \"CDDs Re -organization Committee\", the National Head Quarter of this commodity was subsequently shifted to Bhopal (M.P.) in 1996. The Directorate of Pulses Development is mandated to co -ordinate and monitor the implementation of all CSSs/CS schemes on pulses development from 2007 -08, the National Food S ecurity Mission (NFSM) \u2013 Pulses is operational in 29 States, 638 districts in the Country.

The Directorate of Pulses Development is mandated to co -ordinate and monitor the implementation of all CSSs/CS schemes on pulses development from 2007 -08, the National Food S ecurity Mission (NFSM) \u2013 Pulses is operational in 29 States, 638 districts in the Country. With the bi -focal responsibilities for the assigned states MP & CG at present, this CDD functions as Regional office of DAC&FW for coordination and monitoring of al l the crop related CS/CSS and Missions like NFSM (Wheat, Pulses, Rice, Sugarcane, Cotton, Jute and Coarse Cereals), NMSA, NMAET, NMOOP, MIDH, RKVY& BGREI etc. 1.1 With the unabated population increase, Pulses production also have to be paralleled for the vegetarian Indian Society, as these are the prime source of balanced diet and protein particularly for the rural mass. Keeping in view this necessity, a Centrally Sponsored Pulses Development Scheme was initiated as a plan intervention from the IVth Plan (1969 -70 to 1973 -74). Further, from VIIth Plan onward the National Pulses Development Project (NPDP) was implemented in 17 major states of the country. To supplement the efforts under NPDP, a Special Food Grain Production Program (SFPP) on Pulses was als o operationalized during 1988 -89 on a 100% Central assistance basis. Under the GOI -UNDP Cooperation (1997 -2003), Pulses Sector was identified as Priority Sector to be strengthened. 1.2 Keeping in view the spectacular achievement through TMO in Oilsee ds Sector, Pulses were brought within the ambit of TMOP in 1990. From 2004 -05, pulses development were Integrated Scheme of Oilseeds, Pulses, Oilpalm and Maize (ISOPOM). The new technologies, timely supply of inputs, extension supports, remunerative price, marketing infrastructure and post -harvest technologies were the focused area to increasing pulses production with the Mission Mode approach. The CDD has been actively monitoring the programme implementation though out the county, through National Moni toring Team/ field visits allocation of Seed Minikit and its implementation and regularly interface with the Research and other stake holder organizations/ agencies in the country. 1.3 Beginning of XIth Plan (2007 -08 (Rabi)), in pursuance of the resolu tion adopted in 53rd meeting of National Development Council (NDC), a Centrally Sponsored Scheme on National Food Security Mission was launched.

It was resolved to enhance the production of rice, wheat and pulses by 10, 8 and 2 million tonnes, respectively by the end of XI Plan. To further supplement the efforts to accelerate the pulses production, during XI Plan a centrally sponsored Accelerated Pulses Production Programme (A3P) (2010 -11 to 2013 -14)-as cluster demonstration approach; Special initiatives fo r pulses and oilseeds in dry land area (2010 -11); and Integrated development of 60000 Pulses villages in Rainfed Areas (2011 -12) both under RKVY and Special plan to achieve 19+ million tonnes of Pulses production during Kharif (2012 -13) were also implement ed, in addition to NFSM -Pulses. The implementation of the NFSM scheme is continued during XIIt h Plan. 1.4 The DPD drafted the policy paper/ guidelines during 2007 -08, Seed Rolling Plan for the Ministry in consultation with the ICAR. The draft paper proposed increasing production of pulses through area expansion and productivity enhancement; restoring soil fertility and Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects productivity; creating employment opportunities; and enhancing farm level economy to restore confidence of farmers of targeted distr icts. The basic strategies were implementation of interventions in a mission mode through active engagement of all the stake holders at various levels. These interventions include promotion and extension of improved technologies i.e., Seed, INM (micro -nutrient, soil amendments), IPM and resource conservation technologies (RCTs) and capacity building of farmers. Interventions proposed were integrated with the district plan and target for each identified district was fixed. Constant monitoring and concurrent evaluation were done for assessing the impact of the interventions for a result oriented approach by the implementing agencies. 1.5 During the XIIt h five year Plan (2012 -13 to 2016 -17), NFSM -Pulses is operational in 29 states namely Andhra Pradesh, A runachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Goa, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerela, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Telanga na, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttrakhand and West Bengal with additional",

Although, being the largest pulse crop cultivating country in the World, pulses share to total foo dgrain is production is only 6 -7% in the country.

  "being the largest pulse crop cultivating country in the World, pulses share to total foo dgrain is production is only 6 -7% in the country. The cultivation of pulses builds - up a mechanism to fix atmospheric nitrogen in their root nodules and thus meet their nitrogen requirements to a great extent. In India, pulses can be produced with a minimum use of resources and hence, it becomes less costly even than animal protein. In comparison to other vegetables, pulses are rich in protein which are less expensive and can be cultivated as an inter -crop and also as mixed crop. Pulses are mostly cultivated under rainfed conditions and do not require intensive irrigation facility and this is the reason why pulses are grown in areas left after satisfying the demand for cereals/cash crops. Even in such conditions, pulses give better returns. Apart from this, p ulses possess several other qualities such as they are rich in protein, improve soil fertility and physical structure, fit in mixed/inter -cropping system, crop rotations and dry farming and provide green pods for vegetable and nutritious fodder for cattle as well. Although this crop group is more important from the nutritional point of view, there has not any significant increase in area and production during 1950 -51 to 2009 -10, however , significant growth in area and production has been recorded during the last five y e a r s (i.e. 2010 -2011 to 2014 -15). With the increase in infrastructural and irrigation facilities/resources, the pulses get the marginalized treatment pushing them to another poor and marginal land piece. The productivity of pulses has increased about 68% at 764 kg/ha during 2013 -14 from the level of 441 kg/ha during 1950 -51. It is imperative to mention that the New Agriculture Technology (NAT) introduced during mid -sixties has increased the production of food -grains from 50.82 million tonnes dur ing 1950 -51 to 265.64 million tonnes during 2013 -14 with the increase in area from 97.32 million hectares to 125 million hectares. The productivity of food grains has also sharply increased to 2120 kg/ha during 2013 -14 from the level of only 522 kg/ha duri ng 1950 -51. The potential of pulses to help address future global food security, nutrition and environmental sustainability needs has been acknowledged through the UN declaration of the 2016 International Year of Pulses.

The productivity of food grains has also sharply increased to 2120 kg/ha during 2013 -14 from the level of only 522 kg/ha duri ng 1950 -51. The potential of pulses to help address future global food security, nutrition and environmental sustainability needs has been acknowledged through the UN declaration of the 2016 International Year of Pulses. Pulses are a Smart Food as these a re critical for food basket (dal-roti, dal -chawal), important source of plant protein and help address obesity, diabetes etc. In addition pulses are highly water efficient, can grow in drought prone areas and help improve soil fertility by fixing soil nitr ogen. 1.1 Pulses are grown in all three seasons. The three crop seasons for the commodity are : i. Kharif \u2013 Arhar (Tur), Urd (Blackgram), Moong (Greengram), Lobia (Cowpea), Kulthi (Horsegram) and Moth; ii. Rabi \u2013 Gram, Lenti l, Pea, Lathyrus and Rajmash iii. Summer \u2013 Greengram, Blackgram and Cowpea Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects 1.2 Pulse\u2019s Share t o Total Foodgrain Basket: Per cent share of pulses to total food- grain basket in the country in terms of area, production and productivity was 19.62, 16.55 and 84.48 per cent respectively during 1950 -51. This trend continued till 1960 -61 and started decleration from 1970 -71(after green revolution) due to no break through in production technology of pulses in comparision to other commodities of foodgrains. At present, except the area stablization, the prod uction during 2012 -13 has gone down to 7.13 per cent due to stagnation in productivity of pulses as compared to other commodities of foodgrains. Deceleration of Per cent contribution of pulses to total foodgrains has prompted the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmer\u2019s Welfare to vigorously pursue the NFSM -Pulses during the Eleventh plan (2007 -08 to 2011 -12) and is continued during Twelfth Plan ( i.e. 2012 -13 to 2016 -17), (Table .1.1) .

This will, however, require a paradigm shift in research, technology generation and dissemination, popularization of improved crop management practices and commercialization along with capacity building of the stakeholders in frontier areas of research. Genetic enhancement for yield and quality seed would be a critical factor in productivity. 4.1 TOTAL PULSES: CROP/SEASON -WISE CONTRIBUTION Table \u20131.8 Normal Area, Production and Y ield (crop -wise) {A-lakh ha, P -lakh tonnes, Y -kg/ha} Crop Season Area* Production * Productivity* Arhar Kharif 40.283 (17%) 29.795 (17%) 740 Urd Kharif 25.275 12.923 511 Rabi/Summer 8.059 5.937 737 Total 33.334 (14%) 18.86 (11%) 566 Moong Kharif 23.465 9.420 401 Rabi/Summer 9.910 5.963 602 Total 33.375 (14%) 15.383 (9%) 461 Horse gram Kharif 2.319 1.051 453 Rabi/Summer 2.277 1.104 485 Total 4.596 (2%) 2.155 (1%) 469 Moth Kharif 9.256 (4%) 2.77 (2%) 299 Chickpea Rabi 88.432 (37%) 82.914 (47%) 938 Lentil Rabi 13.901 (6%) 10.929 (6%) 786 Peas & Beans Rabi 11.495 (5%) 10.357 (6%) 901 Lathyrus Rabi 4.9311 (2%) 3.84 (2%) 779 Total Kharif 100.598 55.959 556 Rabi/Summer 139.005 121.044 871 Total Pulses 239.603 177.003 739 *Average of 2012 -13 to 2015 -16 (figures in pa renthesis indicates % share of crop) 4.2 PRODUCTION TRENDS 4.2.0 Global Scenario The total world acreage under pulses , as recorded during 20 13, is about 807.54 lakh ha with production at 730.07 lakh tones and productivity 904 kg/ha ( Table 1.9 ).

Plants are small with good branching ability, especially suited for late sown and rice fallow areas (Ch.No. 2n = 14,16). Most widely cultivated group in India (90% of total w orld). 3.2 Kabuli or white gram (C. Kabulianum ): Colour of seed coat white with bold and attractive seed size. Plants are taller than desi and stand more or less erect. Yield potential is poor on account of poor branching as compare to \u2018desi\u2019. (Ch.No. 2n = 16) . Some small seeded white coloured grain also comes under this category. 4. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTIO N It is a small herbaceous branched plant with maximum height of 45 -60 cm. Roots include a strong central tap root with extensive lateral branches spread out in all directions in upper soil layers. There are numerous bacterial nodules found on primary and secondary roots, used as a site of atmospheric \u2018N\u2019 fixation. Stem is branched with numerous granular hairs on it. Flowers are typical Papilionaceous consistin g of five sepals, five petals (consists of one standard , two wings and two keels ), ten stamens (nine fused to form one staminal column and one free) and a carpel with the style borne laterally on the ovary . They are singly, axillary, racemes usually solita r y having pink or white colour with pink or blue shades. Anthesis takes place between 9 am to 3 pm. Self- fertilization before opening is the rule but cross pollination upto 5 -10% extent also takes place by insect. Pods are rectangular, swollen structure, about 2 cm long and usually contain 2 seed in them. A single plant produces approximately 50 -150 pods. Seeds are spherical in shape, wrinkled or smooth with a pointed beak. Its head is similar to chicken\u2019s head with a characteristic \u2018beak\u2019 hence called as chickpea . 5.

PRODUCTION TECHNOLOG Y 5.1 Climatic requirement : Being a winter season le gume, it requires fairly cold and dry climate. But severe cold and frost, especially at flowering, are injurious for developing flowers to develop into seed or by killing the seed inside the pod. Best suited to the areas having 60 -90 cm rainfall per annum. However, excessive rains, soon after sowing or at flowering and fruiting or hailstorms at ripening, cause heavy losses. 5.2 Varieties \u2013 Selection of variety, as per the adaptabil ity to the region, time of sowing, use of inputs and purpose of cultivation , etc; from the list (table \u2013 2.4). However, some varieties for specific situations are as follows : Kabuli \u2013 KAK -2 (>40 g/100seeds) ; Pusa Cham atkar (BG - 1053) , ICCV -2, Pusa Kabuli 10 03 (BG -1003) , JGK-1, Haryana Kabuli Chana -1. Rice -Chickpea cropping system (late sown up to en d of December) \u2013 Udai (KPG -59), Pusa -372, RSG -963, PBG -1, Pant G -186 and JG -74; mild saline soil \u2013 Karnal Chana 1 (CSG -8962) ; drought prone areas \u2013 RSG -888, Anneg iri; high fertile and high rainfall/irrigated areas \u2013 DCP -92-3. 5.3 Soil and its preparation : Grown in a wide range of soils viz light sandy loam to moderately heavy loam in north to black cotton soils of Central Plateau. However, sandy loams to clay loam soil, free from excessive salt and neutral in reaction with drainage facility, are best for gram. In no case suited to soil having more than 8.5 PH. It requires clodded and rough seed bed for good aeration in root zone, obtained by one deep ploughing and a cro ss harrowing. 5.4 Cropping system : Gram is sown after the harvest of kharif crops. Gram in rotation with cereal crops helps in controlling soil -borne diseases. The most common cropping system based on Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects chickpea are as follows - Rotation: - Kharif fallow \u2013 Gram (i n barani areas) , Paddy \u2013 Gram, Maize \u2013 Gram , Bajra \u2013 Gram and Jowar \u2013 Gram ; Inter",

Sowing time: Rainfed \u2013 Ist fortnight of October in central and south India and IInd fortnight of October in North India. Irrigated \u2013 Ist fortnight of November in North India and IInd fortnight of October in central and southern India ; Late sowing \u2013 Ist week of December in rice fallows of NEPZ or in irrigated conditions, where field are vacated very late by kharif crops. ii. Seed rate : Small seeded \u2013 50-60 kg/ha; Bold seeded and late sowing \u2013 80-90 kg/ha (Small seeded varieties are recommended for late sown co nditions). iii. Spacing : Rainfed \u2013 30cm x 10cm; Irrigated \u2013 45cm x 10cm; Late sowing \u2013 25cm x 10cm . iv. Seed treatment : Treat the seed with thiram or carbendazim @ 2 g/kg of seed before 3 days of sowing followed by seed inoculation with a solution/jaggery having dual culture of Rhizobium and PSB. One packet of both the culture is enough for 10kg seed. 5.6 Plant nutrient management : About 5 t onnes FYM or compost or biogas spent slurry with 50 % recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF) plus rhizobium inoculation for bett er yields and FUE. Recommended fertilizer dose is 15 -20 kg N and 40kg P 2O5 per ha as basal dressing in separate furrow bands before sowing chickpea. Application of fertilizer is based on soil testing. In late sown chickpea after rice, apply 40 kg N per ha as basal dose. On S deficient soils, use 20 kg S as gypsum, iron pyrites or single super phosphate to meet the S demands of chickpea. Application of 25 kg zinc sulphate and 10 kg borax per ha has positive effect on root growth, BNF and yield. 5.7",

For correcting Zn deficiency, foliar spray of 0.5 kg ZnSO 4 with 0.25 kg lime or soil application of ZnSO 4 @ 25 kg per ha to one crop on Zn deficient soils is helpful to both the crop of pulse based cropping system. Mo deficiency can be corrected by applying 1 kg sodium molybdate per ha and for boron deficient soils fo liar spray of B @ 1.0 \u2013 1.5 kg B per ha or soil application of 4 kg borax. Spray 1.0 per cent FeSO 4 to recoup the crop from Fe deficiency . 5.8 Water management : \u2018Gram\u2019 grown as rainfed crop in general in India, invariably suffers from moisture stress as \u2018term inal drought, at most critical pod development stage due to high atmospheric and soil temperature coupled with high wind velocity. So, to minimize transpiration loss and conserving residual soil moisture for longer time, a foliar spray of 2% KCL is giving promising results. However, under assured irrigation, one irrigation each at maximum branching and pod development resulted in 25 -70% increase in yield in absence of winter rain. In no case, irrigation should be given earlier than four weeks af ter sowing and during active flowering because earlier situation is harmful for maximum \u2018N\u2019 fixation as the Rhizobial bacteria work only in aerobic conditions and later, excess irrigation may reverse the crop again to vegetative phase with severe depressio n in yield due to ultimately shorter reproductive phase. Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects 5.9 Weed management - Major weeds infestation in gram are Chenopodium spp .

Gram, being a dwarf stature crop, suffers adversely by heavy weed infestation up to 30 -45 days after sowing (DAS), the cr itical period. One hand weeding/inter culture with hand hoe or wheel hoe at 30 DAS and another at 55 -60 DAS, if second flush of weeds appear heavily other - wise crop will suppress the weed by it self. A mechanical operation is always better than the herbici de based as later also provides aeration to the roots for maximum efficacy of \u2018N\u2019 fixing bacteria as well as soil moisture conservation for its longer availability by breaking soil capillaries and creating dust mulch. However, an alternate Integr ated weed management practice is application of either of Fluchoralin (Basalin) as pre plant incorporation or Pendimethalin (Stomp) as Pre emergence @ 0.75 kg a.i./ha and one hand weeding in between 30 -45 DAS, depending on sowing time, gives maximum grain yield. Also application of Oxyflourfen 100 -125 g a.i ./ha or 400 to 500 g or ml /ha at 0-3 DAS controls wide spectrum of weeds in the crop. 5.10 Plant protection measures \u2013 Refer Table - 2.5. 5.11 Harvesting, threshing and storage - Crop become ready for harvest when leaves begin to fall, stem and pod turn brown or straw in colour and seeds are hard and rattle (most important) with 15% moisture inside them. Over ripening may lead to fall of pods as well as shattering and seed cracking if seed moisture falls below 10% due to delay in harvesting. The crop is allowed to dry for 2 -4 days on threshing floor (depending on situation) and threshed by manually or bullock/power drawn thresher followed by winnowing. The clean seed should be sun dried for 3 - 4 days to bring t heir moisture content at 9 -10%. Now they should b",

The outer covering of its seed together with part of the kernel, provides a valuable feed for milch cattle. The husk of pods and leaves obtained during threshing constitute a valuable cattle feed. Woody parts of the plant are used for fuel. It is a legume crop and, consequently, possesses valuable properties as restorer of nitrogen to the soil. 1.1 Nutritive value Protein \u2013 22.3 % Calcium \u2013 73 mg/100 g Fat \u2013 1.7 % Phosphorus \u2013 304 mg/100 g Minerals \u2013 3.5 % Iron \u2013 5.8 mg/100 g Fiber \u2013 1.5 % Calorific value \u2013 335 Carbohydrate \u2013 57.6 % Moisture \u2013 13.4% Agronomic Significance : Deep roots improve physical properties of the soil and pulverise the soil.

BOTANICAL DECRIPTION : The plant is an erect shrub with considerable variation in height from 1 -4 metre, depends upon variety, growing season and management practices adopted. Branching mostly begins from 6th to the 10th node i.e. from 15 -25 cm above ground. Leaves are trifoliately compound with central leaflets, longer than laterals. Inflorescence : - It is axillary raceme often forming a terminal panicle. They open in the even ing and remain open for whole night and up to noon of the next day. Self pollination is a general rule before opening the flowers. However, cross pollination may also occur to some extent ; Pod:- Length varies from 5 -10 cm and width from 0.6 to 0.9 cm and c olour variation from green to dark brown ; Seeds :- Seeds are round or lens shaped, the colour of the seed coat varied dirty white to silver white, light brown to chestnut brown and dark mottled brown to pinkish black with yellow cotyledons ; Root System :- It consists of a well developed central tap",
  "cross pollination may also occur to some extent ; Pod:- Length varies from 5 -10 cm and width from 0.6 to 0.9 cm and c olour variation from green to dark brown ; Seeds :- Seeds are round or lens shaped, the colour of the seed coat varied dirty white to silver white, light brown to chestnut brown and dark mottled brown to pinkish black with yellow cotyledons ; Root System :- It consists of a well developed central tap root with numerous secondary and lateral branches bearing nodules on them like other legumes. Usually tall and upright variety produce longer and more deeply penetrating roots whereas spreading type produce shallow er, more spreading and denser roots 4. BOTANICAL CLASSIFICA TION :Based on plant and pod character and maturity duration, Arhar belongs to two groups i) Cajanus cajan var. bicolor: They are late maturing, plants grow very tall and bushy. Flowers are yellow with p urple streaked at the end of the branch. The standard which is largest of five petals in the flower possesses red veins on the dorsal side. Pods are relatively longer dark in colour with 4 -5 seeds inside. ii) Cajanus cajan var. flavus : This group includes ear ly maturing varieties with shorter bushy plant types having flowers at several points along the branches. Flowers are yellow and pods are plain, shorter with 2 -3 seeds inside. On the basis of maturity, there are three distinct groups: (i) early -maturi ty group - 100 to 150 days, (ii) medium -maturity group - 150-180 days, and (iii) late -maturity group - 180- 300 days duration. 5. PRODUCTION TECHNOLOG Y 5.1. Climatic requirement: Arhar grows well in warm tropical and subtropical climate. The crop prefers a fairly moist and warm climate during the periods of its vegetative growth. During the flowering and ripening stages, it requires bright sunny weather for setting of fruits. Accordingly, temperature requirement is 30 -350C for germination, 20 -250C for act ive growth, 15 -180C during flowering and pod setting and 35 -400C at maturity. It is highly susceptible to frost at the time of flowering. Cloudy weather and excessive rainfall at flowering time damage the crop to a great extent. 5.2. Varieties: Selection o f variety as per the adaptability to the region, time of sowing and purpose of cultivation etc; ( Table\u2013 3.7) 5.3. Soil & field preparation : Being a",

Cloudy weather and excessive rainfall at flowering time damage the crop to a great extent. 5.2. Varieties: Selection o f variety as per the adaptability to the region, time of sowing and purpose of cultivation etc; ( Table\u2013 3.7) 5.3. Soil & field preparation : Being a deep rooted crop, soil must be very deep, well drained, free from soluble salts and neutral in reaction. On e deep ploughing with soil turning plough (20-25 cm) followed by 2 -3 harrowing and proper leveling by planking after each ploughing, to make the field deep and well pulverized, free from weeds and clods, is must. 5.4. Cropping system : The crop is generally gr own with wide row spacing with slow initial growth, the grand growth starts after 60 -70 days of sowing. A lot of inter -row spaces, therefore, remain vacant during the early stages and get infested by weeds. The space Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects between the rows could be profitably ut ilized by growing short duration crops such as urd, moong, cowpea, etc; Important cropping systems followed are: (i) Maize \u2013Pigeonpea (Rabi), (ii) Pigeonpea -Urd-Wheat, (iii) Pigeonpea -Sugarcane, (iv) Mung+Pigeonpea - Wheat, and (v) Pigeonpea (early) -Potato -urdbean. 5.5. Recommended intercropping: Nearly 80 -90% of country\u2019s area under mid and late varieties of pigeon pea usually put to inter -crop giving 4 -7 Qtls/ha additional yield without affecting the yield of the main crop of arhar. The reco mmended inter -cropp ings are at (Table 3.4 ). Table 3.4 . State -wise recommended inter -cropping States Inter -cropping i. Central & southern States ii. Upland plateau of Bihar iii.

Late sowing crop is more likely to be damaged by frost in northern parts of India. However, under rainfed conditions sowin g may be done immediately after soil saturating rains (10 -15 cm) have started. In diara lands which are prone to flood, sowing must be delayed by mid September. Seed should be sown behind the plough or with the help of seed drill at a row spacing of 60 -75 cm keeping 15 -20 cm distance from plant to plant. A seed rate of 12 -15 kg per ha is sufficient. In mixed cropping seed rate is adjusted according to the proportion of arhar and companion crops to be grown. In intercropping seed rate remains same as for p ure crop. 5.7 Plant Nutrient Management : Apply 25 -30 kg N, 50 -75 Kg P 2O5, 30 kg K 2O and 10 -15 kg ZnSO 4 in one ha area as dose. Apply 20 kg S per ha in addition to NP at the time of sowing. For correcting Zn deficiency, foliar spray of 0.5 kg ZnSO 4 with 0.25 kg lime or soil application of ZnSO 4 @ 25 kg per ha to one crop on Zn deficient soils is helpful to both the crop of pulse based cropping system. Mo deficiency can be corrected by applying 1 kg sodium molybdate per ha and for boron deficient soils foliar sp ray of B @ 1.0 \u2013 1.5 kg B per ha or soil application of 4 kg borax. Spray 1.0 per cent FeSO 4 to recoup the crop from Fe deficiency. Application of fertilizer is based on soil testing. 5.8 Nutrient management in intercropping: Application of full dose of nutrie nts to cereal component of pigeonpea intercrop (N 60P40) along with full dose of fertilizers for pigeonpea (N18P40), has been found beneficial. In irrigated pigeonpea -cereal intercrop, the N should be split into two doses. 5.9 Water management : Being a deep ro oted crop, it can tolerate drought.",

In irrigated pigeonpea -cereal intercrop, the N should be split into two doses. 5.9 Water management : Being a deep ro oted crop, it can tolerate drought. In crop planted in June, one or two pre -monsoon irrigations should be given as per requirement. After the start of monsoon, there is no need to irrigation but in case of prolonged drought during the reproductive period o f growth, one or two irrigations may be needed. A pre -requisite for the success of arhar is proper drainage. Ridge planting is effective in areas where sub-surface Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects drainage is poor . This provides enough aeration for the roots during the period of excess rainfall. During rainy season, water should not stand anywhere in the field . 5.10 Weed management : Weeds poses serious problem during rainy season by robbing the crop of precious nutrients and moisture and also give shelter to various insects and pests. The peri od of early 60 days is very critical for weed management point of view. Therefore, field should be kept free from weeds by giving two weeding through hand or wheel hoe at 25-30 and 45 -50 days after sowing, respectively. If manual weeding is not possible ei ther due to continuous rains or non availability of labour etc., weeds can also be manage successfully by using either of any one herbicides @ of 1 kg a.i./ha viz. Metachlor, Oxadiazon and Pendimithalin as pre -emergence spray or Basaline as pre -plant incor poration in soil. 5.10.1 Weed management in intercropping system : An initial 45 and 30 days after sowing period is found very critical for severe weed crop competiti on causing a loss of about 46 % and 34% in NWPZ, 73% and 81% in CZ and 43 and 56% in NEPZ for pige onpea intercropping with cereals and short duration pulses like green gram/black gram/cow pea/soybean, respectively. 5.10.2 Besides manual weeding with hand or wheel hoe, weeds may also be effectively controlled in pigeonpea intercropping system with pre -emergenc e application of Pendimethalin @ 0.5 \u2013",

Application of Quizalofop ethyl 100 g a.i./ha 15 to 20 DAS controls annual grasses and Imazethapyr 50 -100 a.i./ha at 20 -25 DAS for wide spectrum of weeds. 5.11 Plant protection - Refer Table -3.8. 5.12 Harvesting , Threshing & Storage : With two third to three fourth pods at maturity judged by changing their colour to brown is the best harvesting time. The plants are usually cut with a sickle within 75 -25 cm above the gro und. Harvested plants should be left in the field for sun drying for 3 -6 days depending on season. Threshing is done either by beating the pods with stick or using Pullman thresher. The proportion of seed to pods is generally 50 -60% The cl ean seeds should be sun dried for 3 -4 days to bring their moisture content at 9 - 10% to safely store in appropriate bins. To avoid further development of bruchids and other storage pests, it is recommended to fumigate the storage material before onset of mo nsoon and again after the monsoon with ALP @ 1 -2 tablets per tonne. The small quantity of the produce can also be protected by mixing inert material (soft stone, lime, ash, etc) or by smearing edible/non -edible vegetable oils or by mixing plant products li ke neem leaf powder at the rate of 1 -2% w/w basis. 5.11.

HYBRID PIGEONPEA Pigeonpea is the only pulse crop which bestowed with the mechanism of cross pollination, a number of scientists during working with pigeonpea have witnessed high degree of cross pollination, consequently, pigeon pea is considered as partially cross Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects pollinated crop and traditionally high yielding purelines vis -a-vis single plant selections of different maturity groups has been developed through exploitation of pedigree selection. But in pigeonpea, genetics of yield and yield governing traits offer new niches for exploitations of hybrid -vigour. For commercial hybrid seed production in crop, there are two main prerequisites: (i) efficient mass pollen transfer mechanism; and (ii) stable male - sterile source. The hybrid pigeonpea research and development program is supported by Department of Agr iculture, Cooperation & Farmer\u2019s Welfare, Govt. of India, under National Food Security Mission and ICRISAT\u2019s Hybrid Parents Research Consortium. 6.1 GMS based hybrids: Natural cross -pollination in pigeonpea was witnessed as early as 1919 but could not be expl oited in commercial hybrid seed breeding due to non -availabilty of suitable male sterile source. In the recent past the genetic male sterlity system in Pigeonpea has been identified and exploited for commercial hybrid by public sector. Following GMS based hybrid developed are indicated in Table \u2013 3.5. Table 3.5 GMS based pigeonpea hybrids Hybrid Source/Public sector Institution ICPH -8 ICRISAT, Hyderabad PPH 4 PAU, Ludhiana COPH1 TNAU, Coimbatore AKPH 4101 PDKV, Akola AKPH 2012 PDKV, Akola The above hybrids, however, could not be popularized due to seed production constraints, besides problem related to seed purity concern and economic feasibility. As an ongoing programme on agriculture research and development, sincere efforts have been made in 1994 , when the work of identification of CGMS system under ICAR and NATP programme has been initiated. 6.2 CGMS based Hybrids: Stable Cytoplasmic Genetic Male sterile lines (\"A\" lines) along with their maintainer line (\"B\" lines) and appropriate fertility restore r lines, with better combining ability for yield, have already been developed (\"R\" lines).

CGMS based HybridGTH -1 developed by SKAU, SK Nagar (Gujarat), has recently been releas ed for cultivation . Table 3.6. CMS based pigeonpea hybrids Hybrid Source/Public sector Institution ICPH -2671 ICRISAT, Hyderabad I C P H - 2740 ICRISAT, Hyderabad 6.3 Scope : It is believed that hybrids have more canopy than traditional variety consequently less per hectare seed rate compensating higher cost of hybrid seed. The hybrids have tremendous Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects scope of popularization in northern India and other parts where wheat crop can be taken after harvest of hybrid pigeonpea. Similarly in central and south India , early and medium duration pigeonpea hybrids will play important role in summing -up the additional area by way of replacement of traditional poor performers. With the adoption of hybrids, the cost of cultivation would also be within the reach of farmer. 6.4 The Innovation \uf0d8 In 1991, a milestone in the history of food legume breeding was achieved when the world\u2019s first pigeonpea hybrid, ICPH 8, was released. \uf0d8 ICRISAT and ICAR jointly developed the hybrid using a genetic male -sterility (GMS) system, although hi gh production costs prevented acceptance by seed producers. \uf0d8 In 2005, another breakthrough was achieved when a cytoplasmic nuclear male -sterile (CMS) hybrid was developed by crossing a wild relative of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajanifolius) and a cultivar. \uf0d8 The n ew hybrid technology is based on a three line system that includes A -line (male - sterile); B -line (maintainer), and R -line (restorer). \uf0d8 Several experimental hybrids were evaluated at ICRISAT and various ICAR centers, which demonstrated 50 -150% superiority in yield over popular varieties. \uf0d8 In over 2000 on -farm trials conducted in five states of India the hybrids ICPH 2671 and ICPH 2740 respectively exhibited 47% and 42% yield advantage over the best local variety. \uf0d8",

Under congenial growing conditions, 700 -1200 kg/ha of hybrid seed was produced. 7. SITUATIONS/SEASON OF CULTIVATION 7.1. Rabi Pigeonpea This is practiced in flood prone areas where fields get flooded or waterlogged during rainy season. T he states of U.P. (eastern parts), Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha , Gujarat and M.P. may exploit this potential with following practices/recommendations, for successful cultivation of rabi pigeonpea. \u2022 The sowing must be done in II/III week of September. The crop can also be taken after harvest of early maize or paddy. \u2022 Sowing at closer spacing (30 x 20 cm) having up to 2 lakh plants/ha \u2022 High seed rate of 40 -50 kg/ha should be followed. \u2022 Sowing depth should not exceed 5 cm. The seed should be treated with culture. \u2022 Apply N 30P50 (N20P50 basal and N 10 top dressing at 30 days after sowing) and also apply 20 kg ZnSO 4 and 10 kg sulphur if previous crop is not supplied with Zn and S. Fertilizer Application is based on soil testing. \u2022 The crop should be irrigated thrice i.e. at branching (30 DAS), pre -flowering (70 DAS) and pod filling (110 DAS) stages. \u2022 Heptachlor 6% @ 25 kg/ha should be mixed in soil at the time of last tillage operation before sowing. \u2022 Lasso/Tok E -25 should be applied @ 1 kg/ha soon after sowing to wardoff weed s. \u2022 Spraying of Malathion 0.05% or carbaryl 0.1% at pod formation stage, controls pod borers.

Summer Pigeonpea An alternate best way for increasing cropping intensity and timely wheat planting under pigeonpea - wheat cropping system of Northern India with approximately 2 lakh ha area, is summer sowing of pigeonpea alongwith summer moong. Under this situation, advanced sowing of pigeonpea may be done during mid -April keeping row -to-row spacing of 90 cm, intercropped with 3 rows of greengram at 20 cm row spacing. Greengram become ready for harvest by the end of June after two pickings. Immediately in the space vacated by green gram, inter planting of black gram can be done between pigeonpea rows. While blackgram will be ready for harvest by end of Septemb er, pigeonpea attain maturity to be harvested by the mid November. Early harvest of pigeonpea thus facilitates wheat sowing at optimum time to harness the best yield. Thus, summer sown pigeon pea may be harvested alongwith other kharif crops in November an d short statured crops of greengram and blackgram will be an additional source of income.

Pods are 6 -10 cm long, hairy and round having 7 -10 seeds inside. Hilum is white and flat. Germination type epigeal and colour of cotyledons is yellow. 4. PRODUCTION TECHNO LOGY 4.1. Climatic requirements : The crop needs high temperature, less humidity and moderate rainfall of about 60 -80 cm. Water logging is fatal for root development and nitrogen fixation during early vegetative stage. Crop is generally grown as rain fed b ut under assured irrigation during summer in Indo Gangetic plains of Northern India. 4.2. Varieties : Selection of variety as per the adaptability to the region, time of sowing and purpose of cultivation etc; from Table - 4.3. However some specific situation \u2013wise varieties are as under: i. Spring \u2013 PDU -1 (Basant Bahar), Azad Urd -1, Pant U -35, Mash -218, KU -300 and T -9. ii. Rabi (Rice fallows) \u2013LBG -648, LBG -402, LBG -685, TU -94-2, KU -301, LBG - 645, LBG - 420, LBG -17 4.3. Soil and land preparation : A well -drained loamy to sandy loam soil free from soluble salts and neutral in reaction is best suited. In no case, it should be cultivated on saline and alkaline soils. Field should be properly ploughed to pulverised land. 4.4. Cropping systems : The important crop rotations with moongbean are given as under: Rice-Wheat -Moong ( summer ) Maize+Moong -Wheat -Moong Maize(early) -Potato(early) -wheat -Moong, Sugarcane+Moong ( summer 1:2 ) Cotton + Greengram (1:3 in Central India 60/90 cm paired row ) Rice-Rice-Greengram( south India ) Moong-Wheat/Barley Sunflower+Moong ( summer 2:2 ) Moong+Pigeonpea (2:1) 4.5. Cultivation practices (for different seasons) It is cultivated as a catch crop in summer /spring in between rabi and kharif crops, after the harvest of rabi crops, like wheat, potato , mustard, sugarcane, etc., under irrigated conditions. A. Kharif greengram - The kharif crop is grown both as a sole and as an intercrop. Since it is largely grown as a rainfed crop, the sowing time usually depends on the onset of the monsoon in the dif ferent regions. Normally the sowing is done from mid -June to second week of July , which is considered optimum. Delayed sowings would result in progressive decline in yields. i. Soil: It",

Normally the sowing is done from mid -June to second week of July , which is considered optimum. Delayed sowings would result in progressive decline in yields. i. Soil: It has been observed that the crop thrives best on lighter soils with good drainage. Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects ii. Climate : In India, it is grown from sea level up to an altitude of 2,000 m largely as a dryland crop. Although fairly drought -resistant, the crop is susceptible to water logging and frost. iii. Seeding technique : 30 cm x 10 cm. row spacing is consid ered optimum, for modern varieties. By and large, a spacing of 25 -30 cm between rows depending on the canopy development of the variety and date of sowing, is adequate. The plant -to-plant distance should be maintained. iv. Seed rate : A seed rate of 15 -20 kg/ ha depending on the seed size of the variety is optimum. For very bold -seeded types, a seed rate as high as 30 kg/ha may be required. v. Plant nutrient management : The response to phosphorus is highest on red and laterite soils. Application of P 2O5 @ 30 -40 kg/ha along with a starter dose of 10 -15 kg nitrogen is adequate. Phosphorus application has always a significant effect in increasing the yields. Seeds should be treated with an efficient Rhizobium culture for obtaining higher yields. Rhizobial inoculation may reduce the nitrogen requirement of the crop. Fertilizer application is based on soil testing. vi. Weed management : the highest crop yield was obtained when weeds were removed 35 days after sowing. Any further delay in weed removal results in a correspond ing decrease in yield. A maximum of 2 hand -weedings in the initial stages of crop growth up to 30 -35 days, is adequate to take care of the weed problem. However, whenever labour is in short supply or the rainfall pattern does not allow early hand - weeding, herbicides need to be used. Pre -emergence application of Lasso or Tok E -25 @ 2kg ai/ha in 1,000 litres of water",

However, whenever labour is in short supply or the rainfall pattern does not allow early hand - weeding, herbicides need to be used. Pre -emergence application of Lasso or Tok E -25 @ 2kg ai/ha in 1,000 litres of water ensures complete weed control. Application of Pendimethalin (PI) + Imazethapyr (POE) 1250+100 g a.i./ha at 0 -3 (PI) and 20 -25 (POE) DAS control weeds. vii. Irrigation : Greengram does not require any irrigation if the monsoon rainfall is well distributed. How ever, for good crop growth, one irrigation under drought situation for longer period at flowering stage, particularly in sandy loam soil, is recom mended. B. Summer Summer greengram - The optimum sowing time for mungbean in the northern plains ranges from 15 March to 15 April , as this also enables the crop to be harvested safely before the onset of the monsoon. A fine balance has to be achieved in cho osing the correct sowing time which will avoid the relatively low temperature of winter and at the same time would not delay harvest for timely sowing of the kharif crop. Also, a late -sown crop could be caught in the pre -monsoon showers towards the end of June. Late March or early April sowings are most appropriate for north -Indian conditions . However, for optimum yields the sowing is to be advanced to the early part of March. Sowing time for the summer crop is late January in Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka; February in Odisha and West Bengal ; March in Bihar , Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan ; and first fortnight of April in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab . Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects i. Soil and Field Preparation : summer greengram can be grown after harvesting of wheat crop withou t any preparatory tillage. It could be seeded by opening a small furrow in between the rows of wheat stubble and irrigated immediately thereafter. These operations would require minimum tillage as well as time and operational costs. However, in order to obtain a good crop, a very heavy pre -sowing irrigation (double palewa) may be given and the field ploughed",

It could be seeded by opening a small furrow in between the rows of wheat stubble and irrigated immediately thereafter. These operations would require minimum tillage as well as time and operational costs. However, in order to obtain a good crop, a very heavy pre -sowing irrigation (double palewa) may be given and the field ploughed twice with harrow to give a good tilth. ii. Spacing : A distance of 20 -25 cm between rows and 5 cm between plants is optimum. The highest yield of summer mu ngbean can be achieved when seed rate is about 25 kg/ha or even more. General recommendation is 25 -35 kg/ha depending on seed size and sowing time. iii. Plant nutrient management : A starter dose of 10 kg of nitrogen/ha along with 40 kg P2O5 /ha is optimum for s ummer greengram. In a 3 -crop sequence of maize -wheat -summer greengram, the greengram need not be given any nitrogenous or phosphatic fertilizer, if the previous 2 cereal crops had received the recommended doses of nitrogen and phosphorus. The fertilizers m ay be drilled in furrows drawn 25 -30 cm apart with the seed, 5 -6 cm below the seed, through seed drill. It is also necessary to treat the seed with an efficient Rhizobium culture. iv. Weed control : Two hand -weedings, the first 25 days after sowing and the seco nd 45 days after sowing, are adequate to check weed infestation. Subsequently, greengram grows rapidly and the weeds are smothered. Alternatively, any one of the pre -emergence weedicides among pendimethalin, Tok E -25 or Lasso 1 litre in 1,000 liters of wat er may be sprayed in a hectare, just after sowing. However, weedicides control only broad -leaved weeds whereas motha ( Cyprus rotundus ) is the major problem in the summer season. Therefore, one hand -weeding, preferably before the first irrigation will take care of this problem. v. Irrigation : The number of irrigations and time of application vary according to seasonal conditions. At least 3 irrigations, the first at pre -flowering stage (20 -25 days), the second at flowering (25 -40 days) and the third at grain -filling stage, are necessary.

Pre -sowing irrigation is a must to ensure adequate soil moisture for germination. The availability of water is generally scares in the canals during the summer months but there is a great scope of growing summer mungbean around tube wells. Advantages of spring summer cultivation \u2022 The crop has very little or no infestation of insect -pest and diseases due to high temperature and desicating winds. \u2022 The crop/varieties take lesser time to mature (normally 60 -65 days). \u2022 It suits well after wheat, mustard, potato and late rice in West Bengal. \u2022 The cropping intensity can be increased. \u2022 The area and production can be increased under pulses without eliminating other crop to be grown during kharif season. \u2022 It utilizes the residual soil fertili ty when grown after heavily fertilized crops like potato, wheat and winter maize. \u2022 In return, it adds at least 30 -35 kg available nitrogen/ha through Rhizobium fixation which may be adjusted while applying fertilizers in following kharif season crop. \u2022 After picking pods, the foliage can be incorporated into soil as green manure in- situ to add organic matter into the soil as bonus for boosting soil fertility and improving physical conditions of the soil. Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects \u2022 It controls the weeds and checks wind erosion during su mmer. C. Rabi greengram Rabi greengram is grown in the states of Odisha , West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. There is a great scope of increasing the area under rabi greengram in rice fallows on residual moisture or under irrig ated conditions in the southern states. Recommendations for successful cultivation of rabi greengram \u2022 Select high yielding varieties resistant to YMV, leaf curl, powdery mildew and drought. \u2022 Use only duel inoculated (Rhizobium + PSB) seeds for better root de velopment and harnessing maximum \u2018N\u2019 fixation. \u2022 Treat the seed with Emidacloprid @ 5ml/kg followed by Mancozeb @ 3g/kg, two days before seed inoculation, as protection against incidence of seedling",

Balanced Fertilizer application is based on soil testing. \u2022 Keep the field free from weeds up to 30 DAS by one hand hoeing. \u2022 In Rice fallow area, Echinochloa (barn yard grass) is the major weed, can be control by mixing Benthiocarb @ 5 L in 50 kg dry sand as broadcast, 3 to 4 days before harvest of paddy. \u2022 For control of Cuscuta spp; post emergence, sand mix application of Pendimethalin and flucholarlin at 2.0 L + 1.5 L respectively in 50 kg sand gives best results. \u2022 One irrigation at 35 DAS and 2% spray with urea or DAP at pre -flowering, flowering and pod development, is often associated with high ju mp in grain yield. 4.6. Plant protection: Refer Table \u2013 4.4. 4.7 Harvesting and threshing - Mung should be harvested when more than 80 per cent pods mature. One or two rounds of picking of pods are also recommended to avoid losses due to shattering. The p lants are cut with the sickle and dried on the thresing floor. These are then threshed by beating with sticks or by trampling with bullocks. 4.8 Yield: A well -managed crop may yield about 15 -20 quintals of grain per ha.

BOTANICAL DESCRIPTIO N: It is an annual herbaceous plant attaining a height of 30 to 100 cm. The leaves are large, trifoliate and hairy, generally with a purplish tinge. Th e inflorescence consists of a cluster of five to six flowers at the top of a long hairy peduncle. The flowers of urd start opening early in the morning and are completely open between 7 am and 8 am. Self fertilization is the general rule in urd crop. The p ods are long and cylindrical being about 4 -6 cm in length. There are four to ten seeds in a pod. The seeds are generally black or very dark brown. The split seed of black gram is white in clolour. The germination of seed is of epigeal type. 4. BOTANICAL CLA SSIFICATION : Black gram is divided into two sub species i. V. mungo var. niger : Matures early, ha ving bold seeds & black colour. ii. V. mungo var. viridis : A group of longer maturity duration having sma ll seed size with green colour. 5.

V. mungo var. niger : Matures early, ha ving bold seeds & black colour. ii. V. mungo var. viridis : A group of longer maturity duration having sma ll seed size with green colour. 5. PRODUCTION TECHNOLOG Y 5.1 Clim atic requirements : Being a crop of tropical region, it requires hot and humid climate for best growth. Due to this reason it is grown as summer and rainy season crop in Northern India and in both the main seasons in Eastern and Southern India where tempera ture in winter is quite high. Water logging is fatal for root development and nitrogen fixation during early vegetative stage. Crop is generally grown as rain fed but under assured irrigation during spring in Indo Gangetic Plains of Northern India. 5.2 Varie ties- Selection of variety as per the adaptability to the region, time of sowi ng and purpose of cultivation etc, from Table \u2013 5.3. 5.3 Soil and Land Preparation : A well -drained loamy to sandy loam soil free from soluble salts and neutral in reaction is best s uited. In no case it should be cultivated on saline and alkaline soil. Land is prepared like any other kharif season pulse crop. However during summer it requires a thorough preparation to give a pulverized free from stubbles and weeds completely. Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects 5.4 Cropp ing systems : The important crop rotations with urd are (i) Maize+urd -wheat, (ii) Maize -potato -urd, (iii) Maize -Mustard -urd, (iv) Sorghum+urd -chickpea (Central & South India), (v) Maize -wheat -urd, (vi) Rice -urdbean (Rice fallow of Central & Southern Area), (vii) Paddy -wheat -urd (Summer) North India, (viii) Pigeonpea+Urd -wheat -urd (Summer) North India and, ix) Sugarcane + urdbean (1:2) (Spring) North India 5.5 Seed and sowing \u2022 Time of sowing : Kharif - Sowing is done with the onset of monsoon i.e. IInd fortnignt of June or early part of July.

Rabi - IInd fortnight of October (upland) IInd fortnight of November (Rice fallow) and Summer - the sowing could be done from the third week of February to first week of April. Sowing done thereafter yields low due to rains at the time of maturity. \u2022 Seed Rate and Spacing : Kharif - During kharif season 12 -15 kg per hectare seed is sufficient . Wider spacing should be ensured . The crop should be sown at a distance of 30 - 45 centimeter with 10 cm plant spacing Rabi - About 18 -20 kg see d/ha for upland and 4 0 kg/ha for Rice fallows with a crop geometry of 30 cm x 15 cm. Higher seed rate in rice fallow if delayed sowing. Summer - About 30 -35 kg seed is required for sowing of one ha area. Sowing should be done in furrows opened at a distance of 20 -25 cm. Plant to plant spacing should be kept at 5 -8 cm depending upon sowing time and varietal behaviour.Before sowing, seed should be treated wit h thiram @ 2.5 g per kg of seed, inoculated with suitable Rhizobium culture, if urd is being taken for the first time in the field or after a long duration. 5.6. Plant nutrient management : Being a leguminous crop, urd needs a small quantity of nitrogen for early growth period on the soils poor in organic matter. Such soils should get about 15 -20 kg nitrogen per ha as a starter dose. However, phosphatic and potassic fertilizers should be applied as per soil test values. In case, soil test facilities are not available, one can apply 50 -60 kg P 2O5 and 30 -40 kg K 2O per ha. The fertilizers should be applied by dr illing at the time of sowing in such a way that they are placed about 5 -7 cm below the seed. 5.7. Water management : for rainy season crop, irrigation is not needed but good drainage is essential. Irrigation facilities should be available for raising the cr op during summer season. Number and frequency of irrigation depend upon the soil type and weather, prevailing during the growth period.",

Water management : for rainy season crop, irrigation is not needed but good drainage is essential. Irrigation facilities should be available for raising the cr op during summer season. Number and frequency of irrigation depend upon the soil type and weather, prevailing during the growth period. Generally, the crop should get irrigation at an interval of 10 -15 days. From flowering to pod development stage, there i s need of sufficient moisture in the field. 5.8. Weed control : One or two hand weedings should be done up to 40 days of sowing depending upon the weed intensity. Weeds can be controll ed by the use of chemicals too use Basalin 1 kg a.i. per ha in 800 -1000 l iters of water as pre -planting spray. It should be well incorporated in the soil before sowing. Application of 100 -125g a.i./ha at 0 -3 DAS controls wide spectrum of weeds. 5.9. Plant protection : Refer Table 5.4. Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects 5.10. Harvesting and threshing : Urd should be harvested when most of the pods turn black. Over maturity may result in shattering. Harvested crop should be dried on threshing floor for few days and then threshed. Threshing can be done either manually or by trampling under the feet of bullocks. 5.11. Yield: 15-20 quintals of grain per ha. Recommendation for successful cultivation of rabi urdbean : \u2022 Select high yielding varieties resistant to YMV, leaf curl, powdery mildew and drought. \u2022 Use only dual inoculated (Rhizobium+PSB) seeds for better root deve lopment and harnessing maximum \u2018N\u2019 fixation. \u2022 Treat the seed with Emidacloprid @ 5 ml/kg followed by Macozeb @ 3 g / litre, two days before seed inoculation, as protection against incidence of seedling pest and diseases. \u2022 Use a seed rate of 18 -20 kg/ha for u pland and 40 kg/ha for rice fallow areas. \u2022 Use basal application of 20 kg N + 50 kg P 2O5 + 200 kg Gypsum/ha during field preparation, 3 -4 cm below and side of the seeds. \u2022 Keep the field free from weeds up to 30 DAS by one hand hoeing. \u2022 In Rice fallow area, Ec hinochloa (barn yard grass), a",

BOTANICAL D ESCRIPTION : It is an herbaceous annual plant mostly erect and bushy type with four to six primary branches, plant height not exceeding 50 -60 cm in general. It has a well developed root system including a central tap root with several lateral branches, spre ading in all directions. Root nodules, the site of atmospheric \u2018N\u2019 fixation, are mainly concentrated on primary root. The stem is weak and quadrangular and ends of leaflets some time forms tendrils. Inflorescence is a raceme of two to four flowers. Flowers are small and white with blue, violet or pink tinged. Ovary is short with one or two ovules hence, pods are one to two seeded. Anthesis takes place in buds sometimes before opening of flowers in the next morning. Hence, sel f pollination is a general rule. Pods are one to one and half cm in length with a curved beak. Grains are often light brown in colour with lens shaped. 5. PRODUCTION TECHNOLOG Y 5.1 Climatic requirements : Being a winter season crop, require cold climate. Being very hardy in nature, it can tole rate frost and severe winter to a larger extent. The range of cultivation with regard to climate is very wide. It requires cold temperature during vegetative growth and comperatively warm temperature during maturity, with the optimum temperature range of 1 8- 300C. Unlike Bengalgram, it can thrive well under stress conditions of frost and winter rains, even at flowering and fruiting stage. 5.2 Varieties : Based on the region, time of sowing and purpose of cultivation, recommendations etc, selection of variety fro m Table 6.4 .

The most common rotations under sequential cropping are: Kharif fallow \u2013 lentil (rainfed areas); Paddy \u2013 lentil ; Maize \u2013 lentil ; Cotton \u2013 lentil ; Bajra \u2013 lentil ; Jowar \u2013 lentil ; Groundnut \u2013 lentil. 5.4.2 Intercropping : Most common inter cropping systems are: Lentil + Sugarcane (Autumn) with two rows of lentil at 30cm row spaci ng in between tw rows of sugarcane ; Lentil + Linseed (2:2) and Lentil + Mustard (2:1) 5.5 Seed and sowing 5.5.1 Sowing Time : Rainfed - Ist fortnight of October in Central and South India and IInd fortnight of October in North India; under irrigated condition first fortnight of November in North India and for Late sowing \u2013 First week of December in rice fallows of NEPZ or on fields vacated very late by kharif crops under irrigated condition. 5.5.2 Seed rate : For small seeded 40-45 kg/ha; bold seeded varieties and, late sown condition s 50-60 kg/ha and under utera cropping 60 kg/ha seed is recommended. 5.5.3 Seed treatment : Treat the seed with thiram or carbendazim @ 2 g/kg of seed before 3 days of sowing foll owed by dual seed inoculation (culture of Rhizobium + PSB, one packet each for 10kg seed.) 5.5.4 Plant nutrient management : Being a legume it does not respond to nitrogen except for some types for initial boosting of growth whereas response to potash is inconsis tent due to good \u2018K\u2019 supply status of most of the Indian soils. However, phosphorus definitely plays a vital role in root development, nodulation and growth and yield of the crop. General recommendation is 15 -",

However, phosphorus definitely plays a vital role in root development, nodulation and growth and yield of the crop. General recommendation is 15 - 20 kg N and 50 -60 kg \u2018P\u2019 as basal placement at soil depth of 10 -15 cm during sowing/ last ploughing could be met easily through 100 kg DAP/ha. Lentil also respond positively to \u2018S\u2019 (20 - 40 kg/ha) giving an average nutrient use efficiency of 10 -15 kg grain/kg S especially in light textured sandy loam soi ls of Northern India. SSP is the best source of \u2018P\u2019 followed by Gypsum and \u2018Pyrite\u2019. Among micro -nutrient, Zn is most critical in intensive Rice -Wheat cropping system areas of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan (Eastern) U.P. and Bihar General recommendat ion is 25 kg zinc sulphate as basal, a foliar spray of 0.5% ZnSO4 + 0.25% lime (5 kg zinc sulphate + 2.5 kg lime in 1000 lt. of water per ha). \u2018Mo\u2019 and \u2018Fe\u2019 are the integral components of enzyme \u2018nitrogenous\u2019 for \u2018N\u2019 fixation. Mo deficiency may create twin deficiency of \u2018N\u2019 and \u2018Mo\u2019. \u2018Boron\u2019 and \u2018Mo\u2019 is found deficient in acidic soil of Eastern India hence 10 kg borax and 1 kg ammonium molybdate as soil application and foliar spray of 2% each of DAP and \u2018KCL\u2019 at pre flowering and pod development enhance yie ld by 10 -15% along with increasing its ability to resist terminal drought.

In absence of winter rains and where contribution of soil moisture is negligible viz in Cent ral India, two light irrigations may be applied for significant yield improvement. 5.7 Weed Management : Major weeds are Chenopodium spp . (bathua), Fumaria parviflora (gajri), Lathyrus aphaca (chatri matri), Vicia sativa (ankari), Crisium arvense (kateli), Melilotus alba (senji), Asphodelus enuifolius (jungli piaji), Convolvulus a rvensis , Phalaris minor and Avena ludoriciana . Orobanche, a parasitic weed is also seen as major problem at some places. Similarly V sativa adultrate the grain due to its size, shape a nd colour. One hand weeding/inter -culture at 30 DAS and another at 55 -60 DAS, depending upon the intensity of weed infestation, provides efficient soil oxygen environment to rhizobium bacteria along with soil moisture conservation breaking soil capillaries , creating dust mulch. Application of Metolachlor 1000 -1500 g a.i./ha at 0 -3 DAS controls many annual grasses and broad leaf weeds. 5.8 Plant protection measure - Refer table -6.5. 5.9 Harvesting, threshing, storage and yield Crop become ready for harvest whe n leaves begin to fall, stem and pod turn brown or straw in colour and seeds are hard and rattle with 15% moisture inside them. Over ripening may lead to fall of pods as well as shattering and seed cracking if seed moisture fall below 10% due to delay in h arvesting. The crop should be allowed to dry for 4 -7 days on threshing floor and threshed by manually or bullock/power drawn thresher.The clean seed should be sun dried for 3 -4 days to bring their moisture content at 9 -10%.

ECONOMIC CLASSIFICAT ION : Two types of peas are generally cultivated all over the world as : 3.1 Garden pea (Pisum sativum var. hortense ) - also called as table pea, young green seeds ar e used mostly as vegetables and also for canning purposes. Seeds are bold and wrinkled. Flowers are generally white. 3.2 Field Pea (Pisum sativum var. arvense ) - this group contain ripe, matured seeds and mostly used for dal, some times they are also grown for forage and green manuring purposes. The plants are hardy and grown mostly as rainfed without any irrigation. They are also able to withstand frost. Seeds are round and white, grayish green to grayish yellow. Flowers are coloured. 4. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTIO N: It is an annual herbaceous, semi erect to erect, succulent plant with a tendency to climb when support is available, grow up to a height of 30 -200 cm. Plants bear tap root system with nodules on the surface. Leaves are typically compound, with each leaf has one to three pairs of leaflets and terminal branched tendrils. Inflorescence is axillary raceme. Peas are generally self fertilized but cross pollination may also occur up to some extent. Fruit is a typical pod varying 5 -9 cm in length containing 5 - 10 seeds inside them. Seed germination is hypogeal when cotyledons remain below the ground surface during emergence. 5.

Seed germination is hypogeal when cotyledons remain below the ground surface during emergence. 5. PRODUCTION TECHNOLOG Y 5.1. Climatic requirement : Being a winter season crop it requires a cool growing season with moderate temperature throughout the life. High temperature is more injurious to pea crop than frost. Frost can damage the plants during flowering stage. High humidity associated with cloudy weather results into spread of fungal diseases like damping -off and powdery mildew. Opt imum monthly temperature suitable for growth is 13 -180C. 5.2. Varieties \u2013Selection of variety as per the adaptability to the region, recommendation, time of sowing, purpose of cultivation and use of inputs etc from table 7. 4. 5.3. Soil and field preparation : A well -drained loamy soils free from excessive soluble salts with neutral pH range of 6.5 to 7.5 is suitable for successful cultivation of the crop.Prepare a level field for even distribution of irrigation water, free from stubbles and crop residues of previous crops by one deep ploughing through disc or mouldboard plough followed by 2 -3 harrowing and planking after each operation. To ensure good drainage and aeration in the field, powdery seedbeds must be avoided. 5.4. Cropping System : In general, peas a re sown after harvest of kharif crops. The most common rotations are maize \u2013 pea; paddy \u2013 pea \u2013 wheat \u2013 (being popular in Northern India) ; cotton \u2013 pea; jowar \u2013 pea; andbajra \u2013 pea, 5.5 Intercropping : It can be sown as intercrop with autumn sugarcane as tw o rows of pea at 30 cm row spacing in the centre of two sugarcane rows at 90 cm apart. 5.6 Seed and Sowingtime: i. Sowing time : Second fortnight of October in north Indian condition and first week of October in Central India is the optimum sowing time for rain fe d conditions. Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects ii. Seed Rate : 50 -60 kg/ha for small seeded (13 -16 g/100 seeds) and 80 -90 kg/ha for bold seeded (20 g/100 seeds) and late sown conditions. iii.",

On light tectured soils of northern region, application of 0.5 kg molybdenum (1 kg sodium molybdate) per ha has additional effect on yield of fieldpea. Foliar spray of B @ 1 -1.5 kg B per ha or soil application of 4 kg borax per ha is recommended on boran deficient soils. Apply 20 kg K 2O per ha. along with NP is beneficial in K deficient areas.Apply 20 kg sulphur per ha. In acid soils, rhizobium innoculated seed should be treated with 1.5 kg of finaly powdered lime (CaCO 3, 300 mesh). For correcting Zn deficiency, foliar spray of 0.5 kg ZnSO 4 with 0.25 kg lime or soil application of ZnSO 4 @ 25 kg per ha to one crop on Zn deficient soils is helpful to both the crop of pulse based cropping syst em. 5.8 Water management : Fieldpea is mostly grown as rainfed/un -irrigated on residual soil moisture and can sustain drought conditions up to some extent. One or two irrigations at 45 DAs and if needed, at pod filling stage, may be the best recommended irri gation schedule. 5.9 Weed management : One weeding 30 -45 DAS, depending upon the field conditions. Application of solution MCPB or 2,4D -B @ 1.2 kg a.i./ha in 500 -600 liters of water after 6 weeks of sowing, as post emergence, is effective in sandy loam soils .

Application of Metribuzin 250 g a.i./ha at 0 -3 DAS or 15 -20 DAS. 5.10 Plant Protection: Refer table 7.5 . 5.11 Harvesting , threshing and storage : Field peas should be harvested when they are fully ripe and threshed after sufficient drying in the sun. The clean seed should be sun dried for 3-4 days to reduce their moisture content up to 9 -10% to be safely stored in appropriat e bins. To avoid further development of bruchids and other storage pests, it is recommended to fumigate the storage material before onset of monsoon and again after the monsoon with A L P @ 1 -2 tablets per tonne. The small quantity of the produce can also be protected by mixing inert material (soft stone, lime, ash, etc) or by smearing edible/non -edible vegetable oils or by mixing plant products like neem leaf powder at the rate of 1 -2% w/w basis. 5.12 Yield : 20-25qtls of grain and straw per ha (irrigated) and 1 0-15qtls grains per ha (rain fed).

ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE : Mothbean ( Vigna acontifolia ) is a native crop of hot and dry habitats of northern and western parts of India. In severe soil moisture d eficit situations, encountered with exceeding evaporative demands, this crop is rated as most economic and useful annual grain legume. This is probably due to genetic buffering embeded in this arid legume to quickly adjust and adapt to the fast fluctuating situations starved due to soil moisture depletion and nutritional deficiency. These very adjusting abilities have rendered this crop as an indispensable component of cropping system prevailing in arid regions. Thus, boosting the productivity of this very drought hardy crop in major growing state like Rajasthan, might help in breaking the ceiling of pulse production stagnated in India for last six decades. It is most commonly recognized as the potent source of several confectionary items like Papad, Bhujia , namkeen, wada etc. used as daily snaks by the people along with its main use as \u2018Dal\u2019. This crop is used as a source of food, feed, fodder, green manuring and green pasture. Green pods are delicious source of vegetables. Being a pulse, it is a cheap sour ce of vegetable protein for balancing nutritional deficiency. Mostly common on less productive soils on which financially less equipped people having been depending for their livelihood. Mothbean is known for higher proportion of albumin and glutamin fract ions of protein alongwith a good source of lysine and leucine amino acids. Agronomic significance : Mothbean with deep fast penetrating root system concomitant with drought avoidance capabilities can thrive and survive upto 40 -50 days in open fields exhibit ing fast depletion of soil moisture and right from seedling emergence, atmospheric temper ature heighting to more than 40 \u00ba C. These adoptive features embodied in mothbean against harsher, harder and unhospital growing situations for unspecified intervals ha ve led this crop to be recognized as arid legume. It also",

These adoptive features embodied in mothbean against harsher, harder and unhospital growing situations for unspecified intervals ha ve led this crop to be recognized as arid legume. It also endowed with broad canopy; wing and semi training growth habit also prove useful in keeping the soil moist and lowering soil temperature besides help in reducing the possibilities of soil erosion. T hus, it is a biological means of soil and moisture conservation as temporary in situ shetlter belts. These multi adoptive and adjusting natures have scaled mothbean as the only alternative annual crop of sand dunes, requiring no inputs and physical care. T his crop is an essential component of sub segments of cropping systems prevalent and common in arid zone like agri -hortic, silvi - pasture, agro forestry, mix cropping, inter cropping and sole cropping, as well. It is, therefore, part of all systems includin g texturally common poor lands representing the holding of common people, characterized with poor, physical and financial resources. It grows well under uniform rainfall upto 750 mm per annum. Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects 2.

For line sowing 22 -30 kg/ha is enough for grain crop. e) Row Spacing : 40-45 cm during kharif and 25 -30 cm during Rabi. f) Fertility Management : 10 kg nitrogen and 20 kg P 2O5 per ha as basal application at the time of sowing 2 -5 cm below and in the side of the seed with the help of ferti. -seed drill is enough for good management of crop. g) Water Management: Grown as rain fed. h) Weed Management : Due to luxuriant growth an early weeding/hoeing is enough for weed management in kharif. 4.5. Plant Protection: Refer table 9. 4 4.6. Harvesting , threshing &storage : As usu al with other kharif pulses of Vigna group, clean seed should be sun dried for 3 -4 days to bring their moisture content at 9 -10% to be safely stored in appropriate bins. To avoid further development of bruchids and other storage pests it is recommended to fumigate the storage material before onset of monsoon and again after the monsoon with ALP @ 1 -2 tablets per tonne. The small quantity of the produce can also be protected by mixing inert material (soft stone, lime, ash, etc) or by smearing edible/non - edible vegetable oils or by mixing plant products like neem leaf powder at the rate of 1 -2% w/w basis.",

ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE - Lathyrus is considered as d rought -tolerant hardy crop, and is grown in low -rainfall regions under rainfed conditions, during winter when lentil and chickpea are not expected to give good yields. The crop has unique tolerance ability against stress environmental conditions not only d rought but also for water logging. In addition to use as dal and chapatti, it is usually grown as fodder crop. Lathyrus leaves about 36 -48 kg/ha nitrogen economy for the succeeding cereal. Nutritive value Protein - 31.9% Fat - 0.9% Carbohydrat e - 53.9% Ash - 3.2% The major Lathyrus cultivating states in India are Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Odisha, Assam, West Bengal and Eastern Uttar Pradesh. In the Rice -Based Cropping system, utilizing the available moisture, it is grown as a relay crop and it\u2019s a better option to earn income from rice fields. It is also taken as mixed crop and intercrop during rabi and sole crop under \u201cUtera\u201d conditions.

BACKGROUND: POLICY ON CONSUMPTION/SALE OF LATHYRUS Khesari D al (Lathyrus sativus ) has been a subject of controversy among the agricultural scientists, nutrition experts and the farming community in the country for many decades. Though, admittedly a high protein pulse, its sale was banned by the Government as early as in 1961, under the Prevention of food Adulteration Act, 1954, on the ground that its consumption was harmful to health. The controversy arose from the conclusions of certain studies conducted in the past that it contains a toxic element called BOAA (B -N-Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects oxalyl -aminoalanine), now ODAP, which causes a crippling affliction of the central nervous system called Lathyrism. 2.1 High Power Committee on lathyrus: The States of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, West Bengal, M.P. and Odisha, did not have any ban on cul tivation, sale and consumption of lathyrus during 2007 -08. However, this was banned in Maharashtra state. On consistant request from the Maharashtra based NGO, ANI, (Nagpur) for lifting of ban on sale in their state, the Parliamentary Standing Commit tee on Agriculture constituted a \u2018High Power Committee\u2019 under the Chairmanship of Secretary DARE \u2013 cum- DG, ICAR, with the approval of Agriculture Minister. The other Members of the Committee were the Secretaries of Agriculture and Health, Government of Ind ia; State Agriculture Secretaries of Government of M.P., MS, Odisha and West Bengal; Directors from NIN, Hyderabad; IARI New Delhi; ITRC, Lucknow; Pulses Research Institute (Now IIPR, Kanpur); Directors of Research BCKVV, West Bengal; OUAT, Odisha; IGKVV, M.P.; DG Maharashtra Council of Agriculture Research, Pune; DDG, Crop Sciences (ICAR); Director \u2013 DG \u2013",

Kothari, the president of the Maharashtra based NGO, ANI, Nagpur. The High Powered Committee, in its recommen dation revealed that continued consumption of khesari ( Lathyris sativus ) which contains BOAA, causes lathyrism. The Committee, however, did not give any \u201cthreshold levels\u201d to precisely establish to determine in a specific quantitative terms and inter alia recommended further research/data generation to determine the threshold doses from where the real risk starts. The \u2018Parliamentary Standing Committee\u2019 on Agriculture unanimously adopted the recommendation report of the High Powered Committee in its sitting dated 8th November, 2001. Accordingly, the Ministry of Agriculture on the recommendation of this Committee and also of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, had funded a study to NIN, Hyderabad on project proposal on \u2018Experimental Neuro lathyris m in goats/sheep\u2019 to determine the threshold doses of consumption of khesari dal for Rs.11,89,400/ - for a period of two years (2002 -03 to 2003 -04). A. Brain storming session on lathyrus dated 20.12.2005 was convened under the Chairmanship of Mrs. Radha Singh , the then Secretary (A&C) specifically for two reasons: i) Academy of Nutrition Improvement, Nagpur, {Soyamilk Complex, Sitabuldi, Wardha Road, Nagpur \u2013440 012 (MS)}, an NGO has been making complaints/putting the case before the Department of Agriculture & Co operation for lifting of the ban on sale of lakh/lakhodi dal imposed in 1961 by the State Government of Maharashtra in pursuance to Ministry of Health & Family Welfare circular under PFA rule, 1955 on the ground that its consumption is associated with the disease \u201cLathyrism\u201d causing \u201cCrippling paralysis\u201d due to presence of Beta -n-oxalyl -aminoalanine (BOAA) content, now termed as ODAP. ii) Rule 44 -A-Sale of khesari grain prohibited :- The Ministry of Health & Family Welfare says \u201cNo person in any state shall with effect from such date as the State Government concerned may, by the Notification in official Gazette specify",

For cultivation of lathyrus under utera system (relay cropping), no tillage is required. However, for planting after harvest of rice, one deep ploughing followed by cross harrowing and planking is necessary . 5.4 Cropping System : It is grown as single crop of the year in areas where water gets accumulated during rainy season or as a relay crop after paddy often as utera / paira crop in standing paddy, due to its ability to withstand in high moisture conditions at sowing time and moisture stress during growt h period. 5.5 Seed & Sowing i. Sowing Time : Crop is sown on residual soil moisture after harvest of kharif during last October to early November as pure crop. In utera cropping last week of September or first week of October. ii. Seed Rate : 70-80 kg/ha for broadca sted sowing in utera system and 40 -60 kg/ha in line sowing is required. iii. Spacing: Under utera cropping sown as broadcasted in -between the rice rows. Whereas normal spacing 30 cm x 10 cm is recommended. iv. Utera/Paira cultivation: In utera cropping seeds of small seeded lathyrus is generally broadcasted in standing paddy crops (2 -3 weeks before its harvest, after draining the excess water by the end of September or early October). However, planting time largely depend upon cessation of monsoon rains and mat urity of rice crops. Seed must be inoculated with Rhizobium and PSB before broadcasting. 5.6 Plant Nutrient Management Under utera cropping the crop is grown on residual fertility of rice. However, it respond well to phosphorus up to 40 -60 kg /ha except in the case if grown on highly phosphorus fertilized paddy field. For normal crop 100 kg DAP + 100 kg gypsum/ha is a optimum dose of fertilizer applied as basal dose 2 -3 cm side and below the seed with the help of ferti -seed drill, is recommended.

It is grown in Maharahstra, H.P., U.P., J&K., and NE states covering 80 - 85 thousand ha area. However, its cultivation during rabi and sum mer is also gaining popularity in northern Indian plains. Traditionally Rajmash is grown during kharif in Hills of Himalayas, however; high yield is attainable in Rabi in plains due to better management. 1.1 Nutritive value : Protein - 22.9% Calcium - 260 mg/100g Fat - 1.3% Phosphorus - 410 mg/100g Carbohydrate - 60.6% Iron - 5.8 mg/100g 2. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTIO N - Plants may be bushy or climbing type. Bushy cultivars are day neutral, early maturing, dwarf plants, 20-60 cm tall with lateral and terminal inflorescence and consequently determinate growth habit. Climbing cultivars are indeterminate, and may grow 2 -3 m tall if they have support to climb by twining. The pods are slender, 10 -20 cm long, straight or curved and terminated by a pointed beak. They contain 4 -6 seeds which vary greatly in size and colour. Germination is epigeal. 3. PRODUCTION TECHNOLOG Y 3.1. Climate : In the hilly region it is grown during kharif and in lower hills/tarai region, sown as spring cro p. In north -east plains and hilly tracts of Maharashtra, it is cultivated during rabi. It is highly sensitive to frost and water logging. The ideal temperature range for proper growth of this crop is 10 -270C. Above 300C, the flower drop is a serious proble m. Similarly, below 50C the flowers and developing pods and branches are damaged. 3.2. Soil: The crop can be grown in light loamy sand to heavy clay soil under adequate moisture. Among various pulses, Rajmash is most sensitive to salt stress and sodicity . Therefore, soil must be free from excessive soluble salts and neutral in reaction. 3.3. Cropping System : In hills, it is grown as intercrop with maize in 1:2 ratios. In -between two rows of maize sown at 90 cm apart, two rows of Rajmash are adjusted at 3 0 cm spacing with the plant population of 120000 of Rajmash and 40000 of maize. It is also grown mixed with maize and soybean. In plains it is grown as spring season crop after harvesting of",

It is also grown mixed with maize and soybean. In plains it is grown as spring season crop after harvesting of potato and mustard. It is also found quite compatible for interc ropping with early potato due to its high nitrogen requirement and wet moisture regime in 2:2 or 2:3 row ratios. Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects 3.4 Varieties : Selection of varieties as per the growing season and purpose of cultivation from table \u2013 11.1. 3.5 Field Prepara tion: Rajmash having bold and hard seed coat needs a good seed bed accomplished by thorough primary tillage like ploughing, harrowing or discing and planking. A good seed bed have friable but compact soil adequate moisture and free from weeds and plant de bris of earlier crop. Acidic soils of the hills must be treated with lime before sowing. 3.6 Seed and Sowing Sowing time : Kharif (Hills) last week June to first of July; Rabi (Plains) IInd fortnight o f October and for spring (Lower hills) IInd fortnight of March and for bold seeded 100 -125 kg/ha .Kharif (Hills) - 45-50 cm x 8 -10 cm;Rabi & Spring - 40 cm x 10 cm (irrigated) 30 cm x 10 cm (Rain fed). 3.7 Plant nutrient management : Unlike other Rabi pulses, Rajmash is very inefficient in biological nitrogen fixa tion owing to poor nodulation due to non availability of suitable and efficient Rhizobium strain for Indian plains. Hence, it requires relatively higher doses of fertilizer N. For enhanced productivity, application of 90 -120 kg N ha-1 has been found optimu m. Half of the nitrogen should be applied as basal during sowing and rest half as top dressing after first irrigation. Rajmash responds well to phosphorus application like cereals. Its P requirement is distinctly higher than other pulse crops, significant response to P application has been obtained up to a level of 60 -80 kg P 2O5 per ha. 3.8 Water Management: Rajmash is the most irrigation responsive pulse crop due to its shallow root system and high nutrient requirements.",

Its P requirement is distinctly higher than other pulse crops, significant response to P application has been obtained up to a level of 60 -80 kg P 2O5 per ha. 3.8 Water Management: Rajmash is the most irrigation responsive pulse crop due to its shallow root system and high nutrient requirements. It requires 2 to 3 irrigations in NEP Z and 3 to 4 irrigation in CZ for achieving highest productivity. Irrigation at 25 days after sowing is most critical followed by irrigation at 75 days after sowing. 3.9 Weed Management : One hand weeding/hoeing at 30 -35 days after sowing or application of a p re-emergence herbicide like pendimethalin @ 1 to 1.5 kg a.i./ha in 500 -600 liters of water immediately after sowing helps to keep the losses by weeds below ETL (Economic Threshold Level). 3.10 Harvesting, threshing & storage : The crop mature in 125 -130 days. P lants are cut with sickles after attaining full maturity judged by severe leaf fall, changing colour of pods and hardness of the grains. Harvested materials, after 3 -4 days sun drying, is collected in bundles to the threshing floors. Threshing is done by beating with sticks or trampling under the feet of bullocks. The clean seed should be sun dried for 3 -4 days to bring their moisture content at 9 -10%. To avoid further development by bruchids and other storage pests it is recommended to fumigate the stora ge material with ALP @ 1 -2 tablets per tonne before onset of monsoon and again after the monsoon.

It also leave 30 -40 Kg N/ha in the soil for the succeeding crop. 2. CROP STATUS It is widely grown in tropics and subtropics of Asia, Africa, central and southern America and parts of southern Europe and USA. However, central and western Africa alone account for more than 60% of world acreage with marginal and sub marginal farmers in the semi -arid and sub -humid regions. According to an FAO estimate, Nigeria alone produces 2.1 mt of dry grain out of 3.3 mt of total worldwide, in 2000. During the same year, global area sown to cowpea was 9.8 mha (9.3 mha in West Afric a) with average productivity of 337 Kg/ha whereas, productivity of Nigeria was comparatively higher (417 Kg/ha). In India, cowpea is grown as sole, inter -crop, mix -crop and in agro -forestry combinations. Exact statistics on its area is not available but, is estimated to be cultivated in almost half of 1.3 m ha of area occupied by Asian region. Other Asian countries are Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Indonesia, China, Korea, Pakistan and Nepal.

PRODUCTION TECHNOLOG Y 3.1 Climatic requir ements - Being a warm weather crop, can withstand considerable degree of drought and has a promise as an alternate pulse crop in dry land farming. It has more tolerance to heavy rainfall than other pulses. Optimum temperature required for germination is 12 -15 degree centigrade and for rest period 27 -35 degree centigrade. It can grow under shade of tree but can not tolerate cold or frost. 3.2 Varieties \u2013 Varieties is given in table -12.1 other than the specific as follows (a) Grain: C- 152, Pusa Phalguni, Amba (V 16) (M), Ramba (V240)(M), Swarna (V -38)(M), GC -3, Pusa Sampada(V -585), Shreshtha (V -37)(M) .

The improvement in this system can further be made by pairing the rows of main crops and taking one or two rows of cowpea in between two paired rows of either of pigeonpea, maize and sorghum. Here, we can get 5 -7 qtl/ha grain yield of cow pea without any adverse effect on main crop yield. It can also be grown as floor crop in coconut garden and intercrop in tapioca in Kerala and as sole crop in single or double crop rice fallows in rabi or summer season respectively. 3.6 Field preparation and mulching : In hard soil, one deep ploughing followed by two or three harrowing and planking are sufficient. In normal soil only two harrowing & planking is enough. However, field leveling is must to avoid water logging. However, reduced and zero tillage me thod can also be followed if effective weed control is assured through chemical herbicides. Addition of grass mulch increase soil moisture in the root zone (0 -15 cm soil depth) and significantly decreases maximum temp of soil along -with diurnal fluctuation . This provides a stable environment for seedling establishment and growth than the unmulched soil.

Sowing method : Broadcasting, in centre of furrow areas then modified in to ridges after a month. Draw 30 cm wide and 15 cm deep drainage channel at 2 meter interval to drain excess rainwater after sowing. Sowing on rice bund on either side on the day of paddy transplanting during second season. Sowing by broadcasting immediate ly after paddy harvest in summer. Seed depth should be 3 -5 cm. iv. Spacing: Row to row \u201430(Bushing) to 45 cm ( spreading), Plant to Plant -10 (Bushing) to 15 cm (spreading) . 3.8 Plant nutrient management : Apply FYM/compost - 5-10 t/ha as basal with last ploughing. Both these bulky organic manure can be substituted by humic substances granule. 15 -20 kg N/ ha as starter dose in poor soils (organic carbon<0.5%), 50 -60 kg/ha P 2O5 and 10 -20 kg. K 2O/ha to promote growth and to mitigate the impact of water stress in plan ts when subjected to sub optimal soil stress. In acidic soil, lime pelleting of seed is beneficial alongwith Rhizobium inoculation. Add finely powdered (300 mesh) calcium carbonate to moist freshly Rhizobium treated seeds and mix for 1 -3 minutes until each seed is uniformly pelleted. Lime requirement varied from 0.05 Kg to 1 Kg/ 10 Kg seed depending on seed size. 3.9 Weed management: Weed can reduce crop yield upto 50 -62%. Integrated approach includes agronomic (improved) practices like sowing at proper time, proper cropping geometry, optimum plant density, intercropping, intercultivation, irrigation and the need based supplement, use of chemical herbicides.

Crop can tolerate flooding upto 2 days at flowering and pod setting thereafter, a marked decrease in yield and its attribute. Early sown rainy season crop may require one or two irrigation in pre monsoon/delayed onset of monsoon. For summer crop, irrigation is most critical among all inputs followed by weeding and fertilizer. Generally, crop required 5 -6 irrigation depending on soil, prevailng weather conditions etc, at an interval of 10 -15 days. Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects Increasing moisture regime from dry to medium wet, result in significant yield improvement. The response to irrigation is in order of flowering> pod filling>vegetative. 3.11 Abiotic stress management : Salinity, water logging, toxicity or deficiency of minerals are common abiotic stress. The crop is more sensitive to drought at onset of flowering and during reproductive phase. Maintenance of adequate \u2018K\u2019 in soil improves plant water relation s , photosynthesis and yield and overcoming soil moisture stress alongwith improving carbon partitioning in cowpea. Seed treatment with thiourea (seed soaking in 500 ppm soln) followed by two foliar spray at vegetative and flowering phase is another option to avoid moisture stress through enhancement of photosynthesis efficiency and nitrogen metabolism there by giving higher yield.

Ohwi & Ohashi} Origin - Himalayin region of North east Synon ym - Japanese Rice be an, bomboo bean, climbing bean and mountain bean, Chromosome - 2n = 22 1. IMPORTANCE - One of the important minor food legumes can be grown under a wide range of soil and climatic conditions in the hilly areas of Himachal Pradesh, Uttrakhand and north -east hill regions, generally as dual purpose. Its grains are also cooked in place of rice that\u2019s why it is known as rice bean . It is also grown as green manure crop. Its grain production potentiality is considerably high and can serve as a good pulse crop. It has the potential to yield as high as 15 -25q/ha. All the pods on a plant mature almost simultaneously and can be harvested in a single operation. There are many types and varieties of rice -bean differing in maturity, plant type and seed characteristics. So me varieties are completely free from fungal and viral diseases during kharif. Nutritive value : Rice -bean has a protein content of 14 to24% and is free from anti - nutritional factors. Thus, rice -bean offers itself for cultivation during the monsoon season , when green gram and other pulses suffer greatly from diseases. 2. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTIO N - It is an annual, deep rooted herb with plant height of 30 - 100 cm with fast spreading habit surrounding 100 -120 cm. Leaves are oval and trifoliate with 6 -9 cm long.

It is, the refore, imperative to widen the focus on increasing the seed replacement rate of low potential/pest susceptible old varieties by new high yielding varieties with promising yield potential, strengthening of infrastructure facilities for production and distr ibution of quality seeds and taking up more and more villages under the Seed Villages Programme. 2. CLASS OF SEED AND THEIR PRODUCTION 2.1 Nucleus Seed \u2022 Basic seed of variety should be sown in optimum area approximately 200 m2. Field should qualify the norms in t erms of topography, moisture availability and fertility. Recommended spacing (plant to plant and row to row) should be maintained through dibbling or thick rowing, followed by thinning. \u2022 Select 500 -1000 plant which exactly conforms the varietal descriptors. Number of plants to be selected will depend upon the seed production ability of individual plant i.e. yield per plant, if yield per plant is higher less number of plants selected and tagged. Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects \u2022 The tagged plants should be harvested separately. Seed of indivi dual plants should be carefully examined and if the seed/plant produce is not conforming to the discriptors of the variety, the seed lots produce of individual plants should be rejected. \u2022 The seed collected should be dried, treated and stored. \u2022 During next c ropping season, the individual plant progenies should be grown in standard and homogenous field. Row to row spacing should be wide than the normal recommendation of the crop. The main objective of spaced planting is to ensure genetic purity, otherwise the higher productivity per unit area. Here the row length may vary from one to three meters, depending upon the quantity of produce of individual plant. \u2022 Due care should be taken for all the agronomic practices of the crop",

The main objective of spaced planting is to ensure genetic purity, otherwise the higher productivity per unit area. Here the row length may vary from one to three meters, depending upon the quantity of produce of individual plant. \u2022 Due care should be taken for all the agronomic practices of the crop to ensure high seed to seed ratio. \u2022 Individual plant progenies should be regularly visited by breeder, right from germination to harvesting. \u2022 If any individual plant is not true to type and /or sister progeny are showing disease incidence, plant should be completely removed from the field, besi des entire off type/diseased progeny should be discarded completely. \u2022 From the remaining progenies, 500 -1000 plants should be tagged for next year planting of single plant progenies. \u2022 Individual plant should be harvested separately, as during the previous se ason and necessary steps, as enumerated above, should be strictly followed for next year planting, as well. \u2022 After harvesting these 500 -1000 plants, the individual plant progenies should be harvested separately. \u2022 The seed lot of individual progenies should b e examined for size, shape colour etc. of the seed. Any progeny exhibiting mixture or deviating from the seed descriptors of the original variety or sister progeny should be discarded. \u2022 Remaining progenies left after rejection both at pre and post harvest s tage should be bulked, this bulk produce of selected progenies (bulk produce of 400 progenies out of 500 plants) is known as Nucleus Seed. \u2022 The nucleus seed is used for production of breeder seed. Special care must be given to this seed during storage. 2.2. Breeder Seed All stake holders who deal in seed viz.

Certified foundation seed stage II cannot be used to produce foundation seed; it can only be used to produce certified seed. The minimum seed standard for both foundation seed stage I and foundation seed Stage II are similar unless otherwise pr escribed. Production of foundation seed stage II is undertaken only when it is clearly stated by Seed Certification Agency that the breeder seed of a particular variety is in short supply and Stage II foundation seed has to be produce to meet the seed dema nd. Bags of foundation seed carry white coloured tags. 2.4. Certified Seed : This seed is progeny of foundation seed and it is produced under conformity of specific genetic identity and purity standard as prescribed for the crop being certified. The certified seed can be progeny of certified seed provided this multiplication does not exceed three generation beyond foundation seed stage -I. Certified seed produced from foundation seed is called certified seed stage I while that produced by multiplicati on of certified seed itself is called certified seed stage II. Certified seed stage II can not further be used for multiplication. The tag of certified seed is of blue colour (Shade ISI No. 104 azure blue ) besides carrying all relevant information about th e certified seed inside the bag.

HARVESTING PRECAUTIO NS To minimize quantitative and qualitative losses, besides harvesting the crop at 08 per cent of total pods maturity stage, under mentioned . Advisory should be followed : \u2022 Harvesting prior to physiological and pro per maturity usually result in lower yields, higher proportion of immature seeds, poor grain quality and resulting in susceptibility to infestation during storage. To fetch better prices and consumer acceptance, proper harvesting judgement is required. \u2022 Avoid harvesting during adverse weather conditions i.e. rains and overcast weather, however, delay in harvesting may results in shattering pods and losses caused by birds, rats, insects etc. Rogue out the admixtures prior to harvesting \u2022 The harvested produce should be stacked in a dry, clean place in cubical way to facilitate circulation of the air around and keep the bundles for drying in the field after cutting on threshing floor. 2. GRADING Sorting of the homogenous lots of the produce according to the fixed grade standard in accordance with various quality factors is important. Grading of the produce before sale enables farmers to get better price and helps the consumers to get standard quality produce at fair price vis -a-vis facilitate the consumer to compar e the prices of different qualities of a produce in the market. Grading assures the quality of the produce and also reduces the cost of the marketing and transportation. The quality parameters of pulses are wholesome, clean, odorless and less moisture cont ent. 3.

MAJOR STORED GRAIN P ESTS The various factors responsible for deterioration of stored grains/seeds are broadly classified under two categories, biotic factors (insect, rodents, birds, fungi, mites and bacteria); Abiotic factors (moisture content/relative humidity, temperature) Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects Pulse beetle ( Callosobrucus maculatus (Lin), (Bruchid) in whole grain and Tribolium castaneaum , Tribolium confusum in milled product (besan), are the major stored insect. 4.1. Prophylactic and curative measures Selection of site, storage structure, cleaning and drying of structures/site/bags is important. The site/structure should be given prophylactic treatment by spray of Malathion 50% EC (1:100) one per cent solution @ 3 litres per 100 sqmt. For curative treatment , Methyl Bromid e and Aluminium phosphide are c ommon fumigants. A luminium phosphide @ 3g pallet per 5 -10 qtls whole grain for 7 days is recommended . Control of rodents should be done through i) Multi -dose anti -coagulant (cumarin compounds) eg. Rodaferin , Warferin (proportion 1:19) ii) single dose anti -coagulant eg. Promadiotone (proportion 2:98) and iii) single dose acute poison eg. Zinc phosphide (proportion 2:98) 5. STORAGE STRUCTURES Producers store pulses in bulk at farm godown or own house using various types of traditional and improved structures. Generally, these storage containers are used for short period. Different organisations/institutions have developed improved structures for pulses storage with various capacities like Hapur Kothi, Pusa bin, Nanda bin, PKV bin, etc. Different storage struct ures are also used for this purpose like bricks -built rural godown, mud stone godown etc. Producers also use flexible PVC sheets covering for temporary storage.

Storage Infrastructure/programmes/facilities 5.1.1 Rural godowns Considering the importance of rural storage in marketing of agricultural produce, DAC& FW , Directorate of Marketing and Inspection, initiated a Rural Godowns Scheme, in collaboration with NABARD an d NCDC. Its objective is to construct scientific storage godowns with allied Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects facilities in rural areas and to establish a network of rural godowns in the States and Union Territories. Eligibility: The project for construction of rural godowns can be t aken up by individuals, farmers, group of farmers/growers, partnership/ proprietary firms, non -government organizations (NGO\u2019s), self help groups (SHGs), Companies, C orporations, Co -operatives, Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees, Marketing Boards an d Agro Processing Corporations in the entire country. However, assistance for renovation/ expansion of rural godown is restricted to the godowns constructed by co -operatives only. Location: Under the scheme, the entrepreneur will be free to construct go down at any place and of any size as per his commercial judgment except for the restrictions that it would be outside the limits of Municipal Corporation area and be of a minimum capacity of 100 MT. 5.1.2 Mandi godowns Most of the States and Union Territor ies have enacted Agricultural Produce Market (Regulation) Act.

The reduction of loss of produce was aimed in the scheme of regulated market. The regulated markets developed modern market yard with necessary infrastructural facilities. The APMCs have constr ucted godowns so that the agricultural produce brought into the market should be stored safely by market committees. The produce is weighed in the presence of producer/seller at the time of keeping the produce in the godown after grading for storing and re ceipt is issued indicating the quality and weight of produce to be stored. The receipt is issued by the licensed general commission agents or brokers depending upon the case. The CWC, SWC and Co -operative societies have also constructed godown in the marke t yards. In most of the secondary and terminal regulated markets, central and state warehousing corporations also provide scientific storage facilities at prescribed storage charge and issue warehousing receipt against pledge of produce , which is a negotia ble document for obtaining finance from the scheduled banks. 5.1.3 Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC) CWC was established during 1957. It is the largest public warehouse operator in the country. Apart from storage, CWC also offers services in the are a of clearing and forwarding, handling and transportation, distribution, disinfestation, fumigation and other ancillary services like safety and security, insurance, standardization and documentation. The CWC has also introduced a scheme, called the Farme rs\u2019 Extension Service at selected centres to educate farmers about the benefits of a scientific storage. The CWC is also operating custom bonded warehouses. These bonded warehouses are specially constructed at a seaport or airport and accept imported commo dities for storage till the payment of customs duties by the importer of the commodities. 5.1.4 State Warehousing Corporations (SWCs) Different states have set up their own warehouses in the country. The area of operation of the state warehousing corpora tions is district places of the state.The total share capital of the state warehousing corporations is contributed equally by the Central Warehousing Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects Corporation and concerned State Government.

These Co-operatives also provide pledge loan against the produce and storage is more systematic and scientific than traditional storage. Financial assistance and subsidies are provided by governmen t organisations/banks to build C o-operative storage. To meet the increasing need for storage capacity, the National Co -operative Development Corporation (NCDC) encourages construction of storage fa cilities by C o-operatives, particularly at rural and market level. 6. MARKETING CHANNEL The production of a produce is complete only when it reaches the hands of consumers. Marketing channels are the routes through which agr icultural products move from producers to consumers.

PROCESSING AND VALUE ADDITION Promoted by the western habits, foo d consumption habit is under radical change in India. Export of value added products has retained the upward ladder .Food Processing industry is still at the category of small or cottage industries. The Industry has to be popularized due to the wide range of consumption of processed items of foodstuffs in the country. A close study on the issue imperatively amounted to a conclusion that the industry is not less important than the bigger industrial units on various consumer and non -consumer goods. Due emphas is has to be paid to the agro -industries based on the prevailing nature of perishable crops including pulses. Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects Lack of Processing Technologies of applied nature has a far negative reaching implication vis -\u00e0-vis, value addition and by -product utilization of pulses. There is a great scope of canning fresh peas, but lack of facilities for preservation has not made much headway, particularly in the rural sector where all types of infrastructures are not available. The produces of the farmers are sold in situ at low prices hardly meeting the economical aspirations of the farmers themselves. Middlemen involved in the process of transporting the pulse grains exploit the rights of the farmers to sell them at reasonable prices. Lack of processing plants in the vicini ty of the farmers\u2019 field have encouraged these the middlemen to interfere for converting the raw and fresh pulses into various processed food items and their by- products, where value additions are the prime target. In an effort to increase the value of fo odstuffs in pulses, research & development on Post Harvest Technologies (PHT) would come to play a major role. The large loss of pulse grains during harvest operation and post harvest storage (25 -30%) is a major concern. PHT is thus, an indispensable part of operation when food processing and value addition of pulse crops are concerned. 7.1 Domestic /small scale pulse milling in rural sector : Scope Setting up small scale pulse milling units in rural sector need to be expoited to boost -up the pulse sector.

  "harvest storage (25 -30%) is a major concern. PHT is thus, an indispensable part of operation when food processing and value addition of pulse crops are concerned. 7.1 Domestic /small scale pulse milling in rural sector : Scope Setting up small scale pulse milling units in rural sector need to be expoited to boost -up the pulse sector. Although dal milling is an agro -based industry, the rural se ctor is rather deprived of this owing to following reasons common to the rural areas of the country: Non- availability of infrastruct ural facilities in rural sector; Inefficient methods of milling in r ural sector (incompetent methods and machines for processing dal in rural sector) ; Non- availability of suitable cottage scale milling machines which are economical and can be easily adopted in rural sector with the existing methods of processing. Moreover, the capital investments, taxation policies, lack of skilled labour are coming in way of setting up a dal mill in rural sector. The producer, therefore, is almost forced to sell the pulses to the agent -cum-dal miller in large scale sector and in turn purch ase dal from him, thereby giving him major share of profit. Keeping in view these difficulties some organization like CFTRI (Mysore), PKV (Akola, Maharashtra), IARI ,ICAR (CIAE, Bhopal), have come up with several designs of small scale/cottage scale pulse d ehusking machines, with capacities ranging from 40 kg \u2013 200 kg per hr. These low cost, low capital investment machines may help the producer to get value added product (dal), and useful by product \u2013Chunni -and husk for his cattle. These machines can be easi ly operated and maintained by a single family or by a village based small cooperative society either for their own use or as custom milling systems, thereby giving chance for more rural employment. This may have an impact on the overall village economy especially in the major pulse growing regions. 7.2 Benefits of mini/ small scale mills: Simple technology/mini machines easy to operate & maintain and repair by villagers ; Low cost of proces sing and less power consumption ; Low capital requirement, hence, can come within the limits of state financial corporations or KVIB of states ; Can attract subsidy by State Governments and avoid taxation to some extent ; Long distance transportation is not required, since raw material purchase and product sale are confined to loca l",

The scope for setting up such small scale pulse dehusking machine is based on (i) the type and utility of the machine for the pulses grown and (ii) the status of pulse milling industry in that area. It is assumed that a small scale pulse dehuski ng unit like CFTRI mini Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects dal mill processes about 5 quintals of pulses in a day on an average. If it works for 150 days in season (December to May), it can process 75 tonnes of pulses in one year. Assuming 50% of the produce is retained and processed to dal in rural sector, 6 such units can be set up in a district where the production is about 1000 tonnes (500 tonnes available for small scale). The number of such small scale units suggested to be set up in a district is based on the above assumption. 8. PRO CESSING TECHNOLOGY India is the largest producer and consumer of pulses in the world. Processing of dal is unique and indigenous to India. This is due to the fact that, substantial quantities of pulses are consumed in the country in the form of dal \u2013 the dehusked split form. Though pulse milling is the third largest grain processing industry in the country, next only to rice and wheat, processing still remains largely traditional and employs empirical methods of processing which leads to inefficient process ing and wastage of precious raw materials . Processing of pulses into dal or a variety of primary and secondary products adds more values to consumers. However, the operation is being coupled with losses and wastage estimated to be about 10 -25%, depending on the technology adopted and machines used. Still, the processing of pulses is on the rise due to the consumers\u2019 needs and the sound market price of processed pulse products. In India, more than three fourths (3/4th) of pulses produced",
  "of precious raw materials . Processing of pulses into dal or a variety of primary and secondary products adds more values to consumers. However, the operation is being coupled with losses and wastage estimated to be about 10 -25%, depending on the technology adopted and machines used. Still, the processing of pulses is on the rise due to the consumers\u2019 needs and the sound market price of processed pulse products. In India, more than three fourths (3/4th) of pulses produced are processed into dal. During the processes of milling only the losses (as powder and brokens) are estimated to be about 10 -15%. Excessive scouring of pulse grains not only results in quantitative loss, but also qualitative loss since the peripheral layers contain substanti al quantity of proteins. It is therefore, due to this that care must be taken to minimize the losses by using improved machineries and processing techniques. 8.1. Large scale processing As the traditional methods are laborious, time consuming and dependent on climatic conditions, attempts have been made to develop new technologies for efficient and economic milling of pulses. An improved method and machinery was developed by CFTRI in eighties which aims at minimizing the difficulties faced by traditional la rge scale pulse processors. The improved method gives a higher yield of dal in lesser time and at a lower cost of processing. The process is accomplished in two steps. In the first step, loosening of husk is achieved by an incipient toasting followed by te mpering and the removal of husk and splitting is achieved by improved processing machines. The method consists of exposing the cleaned and size graded pulse, followed by tempering in bins to a critical moisture level. Removal of husk is done in an improved pearling machine in a single operation. The gota is split in an impact splitter after moisture treatment and aeration under controlled conditions. The method is independent of climatic conditions and can function throughout the year resulting in increased productivity. The technology has already been released to the industry. 8.2. Small scale processing In order to revive the now -defunct traditional village level industry and to place the rural dal processor on a competent and sound economic and technolog ical footing, CFTRI has recently developed an integrated small scale pulse processing unit \u2013Mini dal Mill. This consists of a dehusking unit, an aspirator and a reciprocating sieve, all run",

This consists of a dehusking unit, an aspirator and a reciprocating sieve, all run by a 1 HP motor. The mini dhal mill can process 100 -150 kg of pre -conditioned pulse per hour without causing much breakage and powdering. Dehusked split dal husk and brokens are collected at different points as in big dal mill. The product quality is comparable to that of commercial Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects dhal mill and dal yield is 78 -82%. The cost of processing is also low. This unit is highly suitable for dehusking of bolder grains like arhar (tur), bengal gram, peas, soybean, field bean etc, while only splits (unhusked dal) could be obtained from green gram and black gram. The pre -milling tr eatment as practiced in rural technology (soaking and sun -drying) is retained, since it is easily carried out on rural surroundings. However, duration of soaking is standardized to suit the variety of pulse. Since not all the grains soak uniformly, separat ion of soaked and swollen grains is essential in order to get good quality product. For this a specially designed grader also has been developed for grading the soaked pulse which can also be used as a pre -cleaner -cum-grader. This unit is run by a half HP motor.

MILLING METHODS OF PULSES In India there are two conventional pulse milling methods; (i) wet milling method, and (ii) dry milling method. The latter i s more popular and used in commercial mills. 10.1. Traditional dry dal milling method There is no common processing method for all types of pulses. However, some general operation of dry milling method such as cleaning and grading, rolling or pitting, oi ling moistening, drying and milling have been described below: 10.1.1 Cleaning and grading : Pulses are cleaned from dust, chaff, grits, etc., and graded according to size by reel type or rotating sieve type cleaner. 10.1.2 Pitting : The clean pulses are pa ssed through an emery roller machine. In this unit, husk is cracked and scratched. This is to facilitate the subsequent oil penetration process for",

In this unit, husk is cracked and scratched. This is to facilitate the subsequent oil penetration process for the loosening of husk. The clearance between the emery roller and cage (housing) gradually narrows from inle t to outlet. As the material is passed through the narrowing clearance, mainly cracking and scratching of husk takes place by friction between pulses and emery. Some of the pulses are dehusked and split during the operations which are then separated by sieving. 10.1.3 Pre -treatment with oil: The scratched or pitted pulses are passed through a screw conveyor and mixed with some edible oil like linseed oil (1.5 to 2.5 kg/tonne of pulses). Then they are kept on the floor for about 12 hours for diffusion of the oil. 10.1.4 Conditioning: Conditioning of pulses is done by alternate wetting and drying. After sun drying for a certain period, 3 -5 per cent moisture is added to the pulses and tempered for about eight hours and again dried in the sun. Addition of moistu re to the pulses can be accomplished by allowing water to drop from an overhead tank on the pulses being passed through a screw conveyor. The whole process of alternate wetting and drying is continued for two to four days until all pulses are sufficiently conditioned. Pulses are finally dried to about 10 to 12 per cent moisture content. Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects 10.1.5 Dehusking and splitting: Emery rollers, known as Gota machine are used for the dehusking of conditioned pulses. About 50 per cent pulses are dehusked in a single oper ation (in one pass). Dehusked pulses are split into two parts also. The husk is aspirated off and dehusked, split pulses are separated by sieving. The tail pulses and unsplit dehusked pulses are again conditioned and milled as above. The whole process is r epeated two to three times until the remaining pulses are dehusked and split. 10.1.6 Polishing : Polish is given to the dehusked and split pulses by treating them with a small",

The tail pulses and unsplit dehusked pulses are again conditioned and milled as above. The whole process is r epeated two to three times until the remaining pulses are dehusked and split. 10.1.6 Polishing : Polish is given to the dehusked and split pulses by treating them with a small quantity of oil and/or water. Flow -diagram of milling process is indicated in box 10.2. Milling techniques of different pulses Pulses like tur, black gram, green gram and horse gram are generally difficult to dehusk while pulses like Bengal gram, peas, lentil and khesari are easy to dehusk. This difference in milling behavior is mainly due to the extent of adherence of the husk to the cotyledon. Actual commercial practices generally followed for some of the individual pulses are described as follows: 10.2.1 Dehulling of tur (arhar) Arhar poses greatest difficulty in mill ing since the husk is tightly adhered to the cotyledons. Generally only dry method is followed throughout the country for milling of arhar or tur. Fig. 1 gives a flow chart for its milling. The cleaned and size graded grains are pitted in smooth roller mac hines smeared with oil (0.2 \u2013 0.5%) (linseed, cashew or any other cheap oil) tempered for about 12 -24 hours, sun dried for 1 -3 days, followed by spraying with water (2 - 3%), thoroughly mixed, heaped overnight and then passed through the rollers for dehuskin g. This type of operation is repeated 3 -4 times. After each dehusking operation, the husk, powder and brokens are separated from dhal and gota (mixture of dehusked and unhusked grains). The dhal thus obtained is considered as II grade since its edges are r ounded -off due to scouring. The gota obtained is again mixed with water as above, equilibrated and sun dried. The sun dried gota is either passed through the roller machine or split in horizontal or vertical chakki or using a patka machine. The dhal obtain ed from the g ota is considered as I grade dhal since it does not have any chipped edges and has a better consumer appeal. In some places both I and II grade dals are mixed and marketed. The yield of dhal varies from 70",

Dehulling of B engal gram (Chickpea) : This pulse is comparatively easy to mill. The cleaned and size graded grains are pitted in smooth rollers at low peripheral speed. After pitting the grains are mixed with about 5% water in a mixer and heaped for a few hours to allow the water to seep in. The wetted grains are sun dried for a day or two. The dried pulse is then passed through either horizontal or vertical chakki . Here dehusking and splitting take place simultaneo usly. The dhal is separated from the husk and brokens. Any remaining unhusked grains are dehulled by repeating the above operation till all the grains are dehulled.

Dehulling of black gram The cleaned and size graded grains are pitted using emery rollers in 2 or 3 passes, so that complete pitting is effected. After each pi tting operation the husk and powder is separated. The pitted grains are then mixed with about 0.5% oil and heaped overnight for absorption. The grains are then sun dried for 2 days.

Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects 10.5. Dehulling of green gram Fig. 5 Process for milling green gram and blackgram The husk of green gram is thin, soft and slippery. While the husk is tightly adhering to the grain surface, the two cotyledons are loosely attached and separate out easily. Hence, splitting into dhal occurs even before good dehusking can be effected. During the dehusking operation, there is also scouring of the cotyledons resulting in large losses i n the form of broken and powder. The method generally followed is pitting, oiling (0.2 -0.5%), sun drying followed by dehulling and splitting in roller machines (fig.5). In some states like West Bengal, because of the demand for smaller sized Dhal, general practice is to go on scouring the Dhal which results in loss of valuable proteinaceous material in the form of powder.

General practice involves initial scouring, moisture application, heaping and sun drying, followed by dehusking and splitting in roller machines. After separating the Dhal, the unhusked grain is treated a second time as in the first pass, and repeated till all grain are dehusked and split (Fig.7,8,9). Processing of lentil is genera lly practised in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi while milling of peas (yellow peas) is restricte d to the state of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh .

Short statures genotype with least lodging and high harvest index should yet to be popularized/opted for cultivation. vii) Late sowing results in low yields due to short stature, fewer node, smaller leaf area and short grain filling period. Solution lies in popularization of varieties with longer reproduction phase and better sink. viii) Flower and Fruit drop causes poor sink realization upto 35 -50% due to low nitrogen availability, reduced light intensity in plant canopy, hormonal imbalance, gas exchange in canopy, soil and water factor, low activity of RUBP carboxylase enzy me at grain filling, high temperature and moisture stress high abscision production and high pest infestation, etc, are the other production constraints. 1.2. Inputs related constraints i. Non-availability of location specific/recommended high yielding variet ies quality certified seeds at all levels as the production and distribution is usually for the very old and known varieties which are generally poor performers. ii.

Quality cluster demonstrations have been an observation across the board. v) Interface between State Department of Agriculture (SDA) and State Agricultural Universities (SAUs), ICAR ( ATARI ) and Department of Agriculture & Cooperation DAC and other allied state level/district level field functionaries also seems to be bleak and visible with the absolute communication gap in conduction/organization of FLDs , and cluster demonstration s, FFS, IPM, etc. 2. SUGGESTIONS 2.1. Input related Interventio ns Input related constraints are the major bottlenecks in increasing area and production of pulses in the country, following may, therefore, be suggested: (i) Commensurate to the requirement of quality certified seed , the existing (2011 -12) seed replacement r ate (SRR) in arhar (22%), mung (30%), urd (34%), gram (20%) and masoor Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects (22%) has to be brought at the level of at least 33% upto the terminal year of XII plan (2016 - 17). Comprehensive five year seed rolling plan (variety -wise/Season -wise) for all three sta ges of seeds viz breeder \u2013 foundation \u2013 certified seed production may be prepared by SDA.

(iv) To ensure the timeliness, availability of quality inputs at cost effective and approachable common panchait/village place, each potential district, its blocks should identify village - clusters, formulate Pulses Self -Help Groups (PSHG). Under the chairmanship of Rural Agriculture Ex tension Officer (RAEO) or ADO. A committee, comprising of representatives from PSHG, Cooperative society, local rural bank, pesticide dealer, block Electricity Board and panchayt representative may be constituted. The committee should prepare season -wise Strategic Pulses Production Plan (SPPP), delineating input requirement, much in advance. The SPPP should be fine -tuned by the ADO -further refined by the Deputy Director Agriculture for final appraisal/review/approval by Chief Executive Officer/District Magi strate, Chairman of DFSMEC/ATMA. (v) Supply of electricity for critical irrigation at the critical period of crop growth, credit support and all such vital input aspects may be properly addressed in an institutionalized manner by the DFSMEC. 2.2. Production re lated Interventions Based on the analysis of production and productivity on all India basis (crop -wise analysis), ten potential districts each for pigeonpea, chickpea, blackgram, greengram and lentil, categorised as the major contributors (5 -40 per cent of total all India production in the specific pulse crop), may be adopted by the respective SDAs/SAUs.

(NAFED), Govt. of India, New Delhi. The targetted pulses within the purview of Price support Scheme (PSS) are pigeonpea, gram, lentil, pea, mungbean and urdbean. In view of its major production share in the country, states need to strongly pursue its position to central nodal agency (DAC) for recommendation of more cash credit limit (CCL) to NAFED to be sanctioned by RBI through SBI (up to 75% of hypothecation of stock keeping a margin of 25% in accordance to banking norms). State Marketing Federations can also initiate a similar PSS syste m in the larger interest of pulse growers by way of provisioning a revolving fund commensurate to proposed procurement. 2.4.

The frontline demonstrations conducted in different agro -climatic regions on important pulse crops wi th a view to demonstrate and assess the befefits of new varieties and technologies under diverse cropping systems have revealed the existing potential of productivity to be exploited through technological interventions. A package technology like improved c ultivar, Rhizobium inoculation, use of sulphur, INM, application of pendimethalin, foliar spray of urea, IPM etc may be vigorously pursued. For attaining production of pulses 23.50 million tonnes in 2020 and 27.50 million tonnes in 2025, there is need of increase in productivity of pulses up to 900 kg/ha and 1000 kg/ha, respectively. The following initiatives are being under taken to attain required production of pulses. \u2022 Focus is on key areas like seeds of improved varieties, irrigation tailored to pul ses (especially micro irrigation), bringing new niche areas under pulse cultivation, attractive minimum support price (MSP) and markets that allow farmers to increase their profitability aligned to improved farmer welfare. \u2022 About 3 8 lakh quintals of quality seed are estimated to be required to achieve 3 3% Seed Replacement Rate (SRR). In order to increase availability of quality seeds of improved varieties, the following new initiatives have been taken: \u2022 Total of 7.85 lakhs minikits of newer varieties are allo cated for the year 2016 -17 free of cost to farmers through State Governments for faster spread of seed of newer varieties. \u2022 Demonstrations of pulses on 31,000 hectares on improved production technology including seed are being conducted by 534 KVKs to sprea d seed of newer varieties and create awareness among the farmers. \u2022 For ensuring the availability of quality seeds of pulses, 100 seed hubs are being established in 22 states during 2016 -17 through ICAR institutes, State Agriculture Universities and KVKs. An amount of Rs. 1.50 crore is approved for each seed hub and 1000 quintals of quality seed is to be produced at each seed hub. \u2022 An amount of Rs 20.39 crores is being provided to twelve ICAR Institute and State Agriculture Universities for strengthening infrastructure for production of breeder seed of pulses with an additional target of 3717 quintals in 2016 -17.",

Usually legume face a problem of delayed sowing caused by late harvest of rice (in late November or December). This problem can be overcome by introducing short duration hi gh yielding rice varieties with its earlier planting as dry seeding/ DSR and early transplanting. ii. Relay sowing (uttera cropping) of lentil, khesari, small seeded chickpea and pea can also solve the problem of late sowing. iii. For maximum yield, DAP or SSP appl ication is recommended for better and sturdy root development. So as to enable the crop to extract moisture from deeper zone for a longer time. iv. Recently released chickpea varieties viz. wilt resistant (JAKI 9218, JG 6, WCG 3, RVG 201, Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects RVG 101, PKV Harita (AKG 9303 -12), Wilt tolerant varieties (RSG 902, BGD 103, Phule G 0517, GJG 3, PKV Kabuli 4, RVG 203) and Ascochyta blight resistant varieties (GJG 0809, Samrat (GNG -469), PBG -5, CSG 515) supplemented with management practice for wilt and root rot are the best option.

For good crop establi shment, adopt seed priming (soaking the seeds over night in water surface, drying and sowing next day), seed treatment with effective Rhizobium strain, sowing of seed into deeper moist soil (in case of chickpea), lime pelleting for acidic soil and gypsum i n saline areas must be encouraged. vi. To avoid major biotic stresses likely to threat pulses grown after rice (viz wilt root rot and seed rot), various integrated pest and disease management strategies should be followed, including seed treatment etc., with f ungicides as basic strategy. vii. In the identified target sites, it will be necessary to conduct on farm demonstrations of the technologies with necessary minimum affordable inputs. This would be best done through farmers -managed trials, soliciting participati on in the total exercise at the outset. viii. As per FAO recommendation for integrated plant nutrient management for pulse based cropping system in rice -rice-greengram/soybean system, N should be applied to both the rice crops, P to dry season rice and K, S and Zn to the second crop. ix. In rainfed rice -pulse system, fertilizers should be applied to rice only. If moisture conditions are favourable, 20 kg P 2O5/ha may be applied to pulse. x. In maize+pulse intercropping system, N should be applied to maize, P to both the crops and K,S and Zn to maize, if needed. xi.

To inoculate 10 Kg seed of pulses, add 100 g gur (jaggery) + 20g gum arabica + heat -up for 30 minutes to prepare homogenous mixture, cool and add a packet (200 -250 g) of culture and mix thoroughly. Pour this slurry over the heap of seed to be treated. Mix the seed homogenously with hands. Spread the treated seeds over clean surface for drying for about an hour before sowing. \u2022 In acid soils Rhizobium inoculated seed should also be treated with 1.5 Kg of finely powdered lim e (CaCO3, 300 mesh) and keep for 5 minutes after thorough mixing to make uniform pellets. \u2022 Use of micro -nutrients like Zn, B, Mo and Fe helps in improving productivity.

The field, therefore, must be free from weeds especially between 4 and 6 weeks after sowing of crop. 2.10. Market strategy/MSP In all developing economics a positive agricultural price policy is incr esingly being recognized as integral part of growth policy. A suitable price policy is likely to accelerate and sustain the growth of pulses output by protecting the interest of the farmers on a long -term basis particularly in respect of deficit commoditie s. It would also help in bringing about a balance in the relative quantitites procured of various commodities. The price support scheme (PSS) in pulses to protect the interest of the farmers, is operational since three decades.

Plan interventions in the pulses sector were brought by the Govt. Of India, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare since Fourth Five year Plan with more focused approach since VIth Plan onwards as under: \u201cPulses Development Scheme\u201d a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, was initiated from the IVth Plan (1969 -70 to 1973 -74). The focus ed area was the introduction of production technologies and improved varieties amongst the farmers. Seventh plan (1985 -90): conceived the National Pulses Development Project (NPDP), merging all the earlier centrally sponsored schemes on pulses. To furthe r supplement the efforts under NPDP, a \u201cSpecial Food Grain Production Programme (SFPP) on Pulses\u201d was also implemented during 1988 -89 on a 100% Central assistant basis. Technology Mission on Oilseeds (TMO 1985 -86): To ensure the accelerated development of certain priority areas of economic and social concern, the Government of India adopted a compressive approach and launched Six Technology Missions viz. i) Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission ii) Immunization Mission iii) National Literacy Missi on iv) Tele - communication Mission v) Dairy Development (Operation Flood -II): and vi) Maximization of indigenous production of vegetable oilseeds/oils etc. For accelerated development and successful implementation of the mini -missions approach, three stra tegic Committees were also set up for Structural innovation viz. (i) Empowered Committee (EC) (ii) Technical and Advisory Committee (TAC) (iii) Standing Committee (SC). The TMO remained operational under the supervision of ICAR till 1987 -88. From 1988 -89 onwards, the implementation and responsibilities were transferred to Department of Agriculture and Co -operation to harness the best of production, processing management technologies harmonizing the interest of farmers, consumers and accelerate self -relian ce in oilseeds and edible oils. The TMO pursued a Mission -Mode -Approach by forming a consortium of concerned department and stake holders. TMOP (1990 -91): Pulse development programmes were brought to the ambit of the Mission in August 1990. Thereafter Oi lpalm (1992 -93) and Maize (May,1995) also became the part of it, renaming the TMO as Technology Mission on Oilseeds, Pulses and Maize (TMOP&M).

ISOPOM (2004 -05 to 2009 -10): From April 2004 to March 2010, on the advice of the Planning Commission, \u201cIntegrated Schemes of Oilseeds, Pulses, Oilpalm and Maize (ISOPOM)\u201d has been under implementation by m erging 4 ongoing schemes of NPDP, OPP, OPDP and AMDP. The ISOPOM had a more focussed and integrated approach. To strengthen the market invention and effective pricing policies were some of the added features of this programme. NFSM -Pulses (2007 -08): From 2007 -08 (Rabi), in pursuance of the resolution adopted in 53rd meeting of National Development Council, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme on\u201d National Food Security Mission was launched. It was resolved to enhance the production of rice, wheat and pulses by 10, 8 and 2 million tonnes, respectively by the end of XI Plan. The implementation of the NFSM scheme is continued during XII Plan. The NFSM aimed at increasing production of rice, wheat and pulses through area expansion and productivity enhancement; restori ng soil fertility and productivity; creating employment opportunities; and enhancing farm level economy to restore confidence of farmers of targeted districts.

The NFSM aimed at increasing production of rice, wheat and pulses through area expansion and productivity enhancement; restori ng soil fertility and productivity; creating employment opportunities; and enhancing farm level economy to restore confidence of farmers of targeted districts. The basic strategies were implementation of interventions in a mission mode through active engag ement of all the stake holders at various levels. These interventions includes promotion and extension of improved technologies i.e., Seed, Integrated Nutrient Management (micro -nutrient, soil amendments), IPM and resource conservation technologies along w ith capacity building of farmers. Flow of fund closely monitored to ensure that intervention reach the target beneficiaries on time, Interventions proposed were integrated with the district plan and target for each identified district was fixed. Constant m onitoring and concurrent evaluation were done for assessing the impact of the interventions for a result oriented approach by the implementing agencies. NFSM + Special initiatives (2010 -11 to 2013 -14): To accelerate the pulses production, a centrally spon sored Accelerated Pulses Production Programme (A3P) (2010 -11 to 2013 -14)- cluster demonstration approach from; Special initiatives for \u201cpulses and oilseeds in dry land area\u201d under RKVY during 2010 -11; Integrated development of 60000 Pulses villages in Rainf ed Areas under RKVY during 2011 -12 and \u201cSpecial plan to achieve 19+ million tonnes of Pulses production during Kharif 2012 -13\u201d were also been implemented.

Area expansion During the first five year plan (1951 -56), the average pulse acreage of 21 million hectares maintained an increasing trend till Third plan (1961 -66) where an area of about 24 million ha was occupied. However, there was a slight drop in area coverage i.e. 22.21 million hectares during the Fourth plan (1969 -74) despite the introduction of first centra lly sponsored Pulses Development Scheme. It is also a fact that the normal average area of pulses enhanced to about three million ha during IInd five year plans, the periods when average per cent coverage under pulses was about 8 - 9 percent. It is observed that the role of plan funds had catalytic role especially in stabilization of area coverage under pulses as beyond the IIIrd five year plan, the normal five year plan area has been between 22 -23million hectares, a visible two million hectares increase over the Ist plan period. Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects Another most important observation is stability in pulse area from eighth plan(1992 -97) period to tenth plan period (2002 -07)and eleventh to twelfth plan period (2007 -12 to 2012 -2015). The plan period had the critical intervention in pulses sector through the Technology Mission (TMOP) and National Food Security Mission (NFSM) with the increase in irrigation coverage, 13% and 18.6 % of total pulses stablized in irrigated area. 3.2. Production enhancement During the initial phase of the Ist Five year plan (1951 -56), the production of pulses was 10 million tonnes. There was a slight fall during the IVth Plan (1969 -74) from the IIIrd plan recording the average production of 10.90 Million tonnes. However, there was a homogeneous increase th ereafter.

With the inclusion of pulses development under TMOP during August 1990, the beneficial impacts were realized during the VIIIth Plan (1992 -97) andXth Plan (2002 -07) the country witnessed an average plan period production of 13.34 Million tones and 13.35 million tonesrespectively, the maximum ever achieved during the pre TMOP Five year plans periods. During Xth plan (2002 -07), inspite of the consecutive droughts/flood in the major pulses growing states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, B ihar Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra and stagnant area coverage, the country harnessed an average production of 13.35 lakh tonnes which may be attributed to TMOPs critical intervention and Central funding support under NPDP/ISOPOM making a dent on seeds/irr igation and other infrastructural support to farmers. During the course of implementation of NFSM throughout the XIth & XIIth plan (2012 -13 to 2014 -15), the country witnessed a significant increase in production of pulses i.e. 15.97 Million tons and19.82 Million tons respectively , the maximum ever achieved. 3.3. Productivity Productivity of pulses has also increased during the TMOP period. Pre -TMOP plan period average yield during the first plan (1951 -56) was only 475 Kg/ha and the Third Plan (1961 -66) even exhibited minimum productivity of about 467 kg/ha whereas, maximum average yield was recorded (598 Kg/ha) during the Nineth Plan (1997 -2002), Approximately 131 Kg/ha increase in productivity levels between the Pre -TMOP (1961 -66) and during the TMOP perio d recorded. Similarly, d uring the NFSM plan period, eleventh and twelfth plan, productivity was achieved 661 kg/ha and 746 kg/ha respectively. Although this productivity is still below the world\u2019s average productivity of 904 kg/ha and as also what has been realized under the frontline demonstrations of ICAR. A group productivity gap in chickpea -54%; lentil -59%; pigeonpea (early -37%, medium -100%, long duration >71%); Mungbean ( Kharif -73, Rabi - >100%); urdbean ( Kharif -68% and Rabi - rice fallow -51% and normal -104%), under total pulses between the FLDs and states\u2019 average is the existing potential and a challenge for both the research and",

Irrigation The production and productivity increase during TMOP period against the stag nant area coverage under pulses may be attributed to adoption of modern technology based package of practices, more coverage of area under irrigation including various inputs. These could be Pulses in India Retrospect & Prospects possible because of the launching of TMOP in 350 districts of 30 states/Union Territories, nation -wide. It can be assumed that if the pace of pulses production in the country is constantly maintained, the pulse requirement could be easily met in the long run. Inadequate irrigation facilities, especially the supply of cr itical irrigation, are the main cause of low production of Indian pulses. Taking the average of the five years of the first Five Year Plan (1951 -56), the coverage of area under irrigation was hardly 9.18%. There was a decreasing trend till the Fifth plan. However, the increasing trend was restored from the Sixth plan with the maximum coverage of 12 -13% from eighth plan onward i.e. the initial phase of the launching of TMOP, attributing the productivity enhancement i.e. about 600 kg/ha (VIII -X plan). During the NFSM plan period, irrigation increased upto 19%, attributing the productivity enhancement i.e. about 746 kg/ha (Twelfth plan). 3.5 Conclusion The demand for Pulses is projected to grow at about 2% per year on account of the increase in population and g rowth in direct demand. This growth rate is almost four times the growth rate experienced in the domestic production of the food grains including pulses during the last decade. This has created serious imbalnces between domestic production and demand whic h for some time was met by liquidating stocks and cutting down on exports. If the growth rate of dometic production of pulses fails to rise to the required level, it would result in lead to increase dependence on imports to met the domestic demand. If we",

If the growth rate of dometic production of pulses fails to rise to the required level, it would result in lead to increase dependence on imports to met the domestic demand. If we want to meet the domestic demand of pulse requirement, we must increase production or depend on imports. As Agriculture growth is limited, imports will help improve the supply situation in the short term whereas, the long term, we will need to focus on pro ductivity increase, through public capital formation in irrigation, Quality seeds of promising varieties and their availability at least 33% SRR, research and efficient use of water, plant nutrition and other necessary inputs. Policy initiatives must lea d for efficie ncy and help in maintaining balance between domestic production and demand. It we strive to achieve these potential yield levels, then the increasing demand requirement of the country can be met in future. In order to give the much needed fil lip to pulse production, the government has given emphasis on pulses through various developmental programmes and has been significantly increasing the MSP for most pulses. This has resulted in an above normal growth in pulses production in recent years. In the past four years, there has been significant increase in pulse consumption averaging 50 grams due to somewhat higher production and larger imports.
