This chapter explores the agronomy, production technologies, and economic significance of major cereals and millets, along with region-specific cultivation practices, constraints, and future prospects. 9.1 Introduction to Cereals and Millets Cereals and millets are cultivated grasses that produce edible grains. Cereals such as rice, wheat, and maize dominate global food production, while millets, including sorghum, pearl millet, finger millet , and minor millets, play a vital role in food security, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. Cereals: Known for their high carbohydrate content, they are energy-rich and form the bulk of caloric intake worldwide. Millets: Although lower in yields, they are rich in dietary fiber, micronutrients, and drought resistance, making them vital for nutritional security and sustainable agriculture. 74 9.2 Importance in Food Security and Nutrition Cereals and millets are indispensable to global food security and human nutrition. As staple foods for the majority of the world\u2019s population, especially in developing nations, they supply a substantial portion of daily caloric intake, proteins, and essential nutrients. Their cultivation, consumption, and trade form the backbone of national and international food systems. Food Security Contribution Cereals such as rice, wheat, and maize account for more than 70% of the global grain production. They are widely cultivated, easy to store and transport, and adaptable to various agro-climatic zones. Because of their scalability and high energy content, cereals are central to the fight against hunger. Government food security schemes, such as the Public Distribution System (PDS) in India or global grain reserves, heavily rely on cereals to maintain buffer stocks and ensure the availability of affordable food. Millets, though historically underutilized, are gaining attention as \u201cclimate-smart\u201d crops that contribute significantly to food security in marginal and rainfed areas , where major cereals may fail due to",
  "various agro-climatic zones. Because of their scalability and high energy content, cereals are central to the fight against hunger. Government food security schemes, such as the Public Distribution System (PDS) in India or global grain reserves, heavily rely on cereals to maintain buffer stocks and ensure the availability of affordable food. Millets, though historically underutilized, are gaining attention as \u201cclimate-smart\u201d crops that contribute significantly to food security in marginal and rainfed areas , where major cereals may fail due to poor soils or erratic rainfall. Millets have short growing cycles, require minimal inputs, and are resilient to pests and diseases, making them vital for small and marginal farmers in arid and semi-arid regions. Nutritional Significance While cereals are rich in carbohydrates and form a primary energy source, their protein content is moderate, and they may lack certain essential amino acids like lysine. However, when consumed with pulses or dairy, cereals provide balanced nutrition. Millets, on the other hand, offer superior nutritional benefits: Finger millet (ragi) is high in calcium and iron. Pearl millet (bajra) contains high levels of iron, zinc, and fiber. Foxtail millet and little millet are rich in antioxidants and slow-digesting carbohydrates, making them ideal for diabetic and gluten-intolerant populations. These properties make millets particularly effective in addressing \u201chidden hunger\u201d \u2014 micronutrient deficiencies that may not manifest as calorie shortfalls but have long-term impacts on health, especially among children and women. Role in Dietary Diversity and Health Modern diets, especially in urban areas, are increasingly dependent on processed, refined cereals, often leading to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions. Millets and whole grains can restore dietary balance by: Lowering glycemic index and promoting satiety. Improving gut health due to high fiber content. Enhancing immunity through natural phytochemicals and minerals. Government programs such as mid-day meals , ICDS, and nutrition gardens are beginning to incorporate millets and whole grains to improve public health outcomes. 75 Strategic Importance in Policy Recognizing their dual role in food security and nutrition, several national and international initiatives are promoting the cultivation and consumption of diverse grains. The International Year of Millets (2023) declared by the UN and supported by India emphasized the global need to mainstream millets in food systems. Subsidies, minimum support prices, research funding, and supply chain development are increasingly being directed toward these crops to enhance both availability and accessibility. 9.3 Major Cereals and Their Cultivation Practices",

Over the decades, plant breeding programs and biotechnology interventions have significantly contributed to the development of improved crop varieties that address the challenges of food security, climate change, and nutritional deficiencies. Objectives of Crop Improvement The primary goals of cereal and millet crop improvement include: Higher yield potential to meet the growing food demand. Resistance to pests and diseases to reduce dependency on pesticides. Tolerance to abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, and temperature extremes. Improved nutritional quality , including protein content, micronutrients (e.g., iron, zinc), and digestibility. Shorter maturity periods to suit multiple cropping systems and diverse agro- climatic conditions. Methods of Crop Improvement 1. Conventional Breeding : Includes selection, hybridization, and backcrossing to combine desirable traits. For instance, hybrid maize and semi-dwarf wheat are products of this approach. 78 2. Mutation Breeding : Utilizes radiation or chemicals to induce mutations and develop new traits, such as disease resistance or early maturity. 3. Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering : Involves genetic modification to introduce specific traits, such as insect resistance (e.g., Bt maize) or biofortification (e.g., Golden Rice). 4. Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS) : Accelerates breeding by using molecular markers linked to desired traits, allowing faster and more precise development of improved varieties. 5. Participatory Breeding : Involves farmers in the selection process to ensure varieties meet local preferences and needs. Notable Improved Varieties in Cereals Wheat: HD 2967, PBW 343 , and WH 1105 \u2013 high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties adapted to North India. MACS 6222 \u2013 suitable for peninsular India,",

Water management : Key for cereals like rice (alternate wetting and drying techniques) and maize (critical irrigation). Harvesting and storage : Grains should be harvested at physiological maturity and dried to safe moisture content for storage. 9.7 Challenges in Production Despite being the cornerstone of food security in many countries, the production of cereals and millets faces a range of complex and interconnected challenges. These issues impact not only the quantity and quality of harvests but also the sustainability and profitability of farming systems. Addressing these challenges is essential to ensure resilient food systems and the well-being of millions of smallholder farmers. 1. Climate Change and Weather Extremes Unpredictable weather patterns such as erratic rainfall, prolonged droughts, floods, and extreme temperatures have increasingly affected the productivity of cereals and millets. Drought-prone areas struggle to maintain crop yields, while excessive rainfall leads to waterlogging and disease outbreaks. Many cereal crops are particularly sensitive during flowering and grain-filling stages, which are easily disrupted by climatic anomalies. 2. Declining Soil Fertility and Degradation Intensive cultivation, excessive use of chemical fertilizers, poor organic matter management, and lack of crop rotation have led to declining soil health. Problems such as salinization, erosion, compaction, and nutrient imbalance directly reduce crop productivity and sustainability. Millets, though hardy, can also show reduced yields in severely degraded soils. 3. Pest and Disease Pressure Cereal and millet crops are vulnerable to numerous pests and diseases. For example, rice suffers from stem borers, leaf folders, and blast disease; wheat is affected by rusts; maize is vulnerable to fall armyworm; and millets face shoot fly and downy mildew. Climate change further intensifies pest and disease dynamics, leading to new outbreaks and requiring adaptive management strategies. 4. Limited Access to Quality Seeds In many regions, farmers lack timely access to improved and certified seeds of high-yielding, pest-resistant, or climate-resilient varieties. Seed distribution systems are often inefficient or 80 unavailable in remote areas. This results in the use of outdated or low-performing local varieties, constraining yield potential. 5. Inadequate Irrigation Infrastructure While rice and wheat are heavily water-dependent, a significant portion of their cultivation relies on rainfall. Inadequate or poorly maintained irrigation facilities limit farmers\u2019 ability to cope with dry spells, especially in millet-growing areas that typically lack irrigation support. Water scarcity is becoming a critical barrier to productivity across all",

Inadequate or poorly maintained irrigation facilities limit farmers\u2019 ability to cope with dry spells, especially in millet-growing areas that typically lack irrigation support. Water scarcity is becoming a critical barrier to productivity across all major cereal crops. 6. High Input Costs and Resource Constraints The rising prices of fertilizers, pesticides, labor, machinery, and energy make cereal and millet farming increasingly expensive. Small and marginal farmers often cannot afford recommended levels of input, leading to suboptimal production. In addition, lack of credit and insurance options compounds their vulnerability. 7. Post-Harvest Losses and Storage Issues Poor infrastructure for harvesting, drying, storage, and transport leads to significant post- harvest losses, particularly in cereals like rice and maize. Traditional storage practices often fail to protect grains from moisture, insects, rodents, and fungal contamination, resulting in both quantitative and qualitative losses. 8. Limited Market Access and Price Fluctuations Farmers frequently face challenges in accessing reliable markets due to poor transportation networks, middlemen exploitation, and a lack of price information. Price volatility, particularly in non-MSP-covered cereals and millets, discourages investment in production and affects income stability. 9. Neglect of Millets in Policy and Research Despite their nutritional value and climate resilience, millets have historically received less attention in terms of research, subsidies, marketing, and policy support compared to major cereals like rice and wheat. This neglect has limited their adoption and commercialization, although recent efforts like the International Year of Millets 2023 have begun reversing this trend. 10. Knowledge and Extension Gaps Many farmers are not fully aware of best practices in crop management, pest control, soil fertility, and post-harvest handling. Weak extension systems and limited training opportunities prevent the widespread dissemination of new technologies and techniques that could enhance cereal and millet productivity. Conclusion Cereals and millets continue to be the cornerstone of food and nutritional security. With advancements in agronomy, crop breeding, and market support, their potential in combating hunger, malnutrition, and climate change is being increasingly recognized. Promoting sustainable production practices and re-integrating traditional crops like millets into modern farming systems is essential for achieving resilient and inclusive agriculture. 81 References Macauley, H., & Ramadjita, T.
