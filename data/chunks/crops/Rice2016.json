  "A status note on Rice in India Background In India rice is grown in 43.86 million ha, the production level is 104.80 million tones and t he productivity is about 2390 kg/ha (Agricultural Statistics at a glance - 2015 ). It is grown under diverse soil and climatic conditions the productivity level of rice is low compared to the productivity levels of many countries in the world. Also about 90 % of the cultivated land belongs to Marginal, Small and Medium farmers which is ano ther constrain in increasing the productivity of rice in the country . It is, therefore , there is ample scope to increase the productivity of rice in the country. The highest productivity is 6710 kg per ha of China followed by Vietnam (5573 kg /ha), Indones ia (5152 kg/ha), Bangladesh (4375 kg/ha) etc There are improved technologies and various interventions which could be adapted to increase the productivity in the country . Cultivation of hybrid rice has potential to increase the productivity and needs to be promoted . Rice Growing Regions : The rice growing areas in the country can be broadly grouped into five regions as given below: i. North -Eastern Region: This region comprises of Assam and North eastern states. In Assam rice is grown in the B asin of Brahmnaputra River. This region receives very heavy rainfall and rice is grown u nder rain fed condition. ii. Eastern Region: It region comprises of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Eastern Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. In this region rice is grown in the basins of Ganga and Mahanadi rivers and has the highest intensity of rice cultivation in the country. Th is region receives heavy rainfall and rice is grown mainly under rain fed conditions. iii. Northern Region: This region comprises of Haryana, Punjab, Western Uttar Pradesh, Utt arakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir. The region experiences low winter temp erature and single crop of rice from May -July to September - December is grown. iv. Western Region: This region comprises of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan. Rice is largely grown under rainfed condition during June -August to October - December. v. Southern Regi on: This region comprises of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Rice is mainly grown in deltaic tracts of Godavari, Krishna and Cauvery rivers and the non -deltaic rainfed area of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Rice",

Status of Rice in the country Rice is one of the most important food crops and feeds more than 60 per cent population of India . The area under rice crop was 30.81 million/ha in 1950 -51 which has increased to 43.86 million hectare s during 2014 -15 which is nearly 142 per cent higher. The rice production has registered an ap preciable increase from 20.58 million tonnes in 1950 -51 to 104.86 million tonnes during 2014 -15, which is nearly 5 times. The yield was 668 kg/ha in 1950 -51 which has increased to 2390 kg/ha during 2014 -15. Major share of rice production is in Kharif season. State wise Area, Production and Yield : Rice is grown in almost all the states in the country however the major 5 states in rice production are West Bengal, UP, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Tamil Nadu . The west Bengal produces 15 percent of tota l quantity of r ice produced in the country .

State wise Area, Production and Yield (APY) of rice during the period 2010 -11 to 2014 -15 are given at Annexure I I. Agronomic Practices : Land preparation The field is prepared by ploughing the rice fields with soil turning plough followed by harrowing. T he rice field is filled with water and is puddle d twice by paddy puddler or once by rotavator. If green manure crop like dhaincha or mung has been taken , it may be mixed with rotavator during puddling followed by planking. Seed r ate: The seed rate of rice varies based on the methods of sowing/transplanting. In broadcasting method seed rate is about 8 0kg/ha under transplanting method it is about 20- 30 kg/ha and under SRI method seed rate is only 5 -8 kg/ ha. . Seed treatment Seed treatment is done by dissolving 10 g carbendaz im (Bavistin) and 1g streptocycline in 10 litres of water sufficient for 10 kg seed . The soaked seed should be for 24 hours before sowing or transplanting . The soaked seeds are covered till it is sprouted . Sowing method: Following two methods are commonly practiced: (a) Direct seeding or Broadcasting method : In this method seed is directly sown in unpuddled and puddle fie ld prepared for sowing at appropriate moisture level. (b) Transplanting method: In this method a nursery is prepared for transplanting of rice as required for the methods of transplanting. For manual transplanting the nursery is prepared in 1/20th of transplanting usually on raised beds. For mechanical transplanting the nursery is raised as mat or tray nursery. The 25 days old seedlings ( 4 -5 leaf stage) uprooted from the nursery \u2013bed are the transplanted 3 -4 cm deep following 20cm x 10cm spacing with 2 -3 seedlings/ hill in the line planting and 10cm x15 cm in random planting. However, in case of SRI 10 days old nursery is transplanted at 25 cms X 25 cms spacing of only 1 -2 plants per hill. Sowing Time : The rice is grown almost in all crop seasons ie Kharif, Rabi and summar in the country. However, depending upon the prevailing weather, it is sown in different",

Sowing Time : The rice is grown almost in all crop seasons ie Kharif, Rabi and summar in the country. However, depending upon the prevailing weather, it is sown in different periods in different regions. Manures and Fertilizer Management The fertilizers and organic manures may be app lied based on available soil nutrients after the soil tests. The objective should be to reduce the input costs to obtain optimum productivity. In general, about 80 -100 kg nitrogen /ha is applied in 3 split doses ; half (40 - 50 kg ) as basal dose, one forth ( 20-25 kg) at tillering stage and remaining a week before panicle initiation where top dressing is not possible. Along with basal dose (50% of nitrogen) 40-45 kg P 2 O5 and 30 -40 kg K 2O are also applied depending on soil test. Bio fertilizers such as blue green algae or Azolla provide 20 -25 kg N/ha, which may be added as partial supplement to inorganic fertilizer. The application of micro -nutrients may also be applied based on soil test. Water management Uniform leveling of fi eld and proper drainage are most essential for an effective water management in irrigated field. Efficient water - management facilitates good tillering and better nitrogen uptake and help s in reduc ing weed population. PLANT PROTECTION Weed management: The problem of weeds is less in puddled fields but it is high in un puddled fields. Usually, 2-3 hoeing or manual picking of weeds are required to control the weed s. Some herbicides such as Anilophos, Butachlor, Anilophos +Ethoxysulfuron, Pyrosolfuron -ethyl, Almix +Butachlor , Fentrazamide , Cinmethyline +2,4D are used.

The harvesting and threshing is done manually and also by combine harvesters and threshers. Export and Import of rice The details of export and import of Basmati Rice and non Basmati rice for the period 2010 - 11 to 2016 -17, are given in the Annexure III \u2013 IV. Basmati Rice: The export of basmati rice during 2010 -11 was 23.71 lakh tonnes while in the year of 2015 -16 it was 40.45 lakh tonnes which is highest during this period. Import of Basmati rice is negligible in the country. I mport of basmati rice was 0.0046 lakh tonnes only in the year 2010 -11. Non-Basmati Rice : India is exporting substantial quantity of non -basmati rice to various countries in the world. However, the export of non -basmati rice has been fluctuating year to year due to Govt. policy. The export of non -basmati rice during 2010 -11 was 1.01 lakh tonnes, the export ro se to 82.25 lakh tones during 2014 -15.

Main Programmes/ Schemes of Rice Crops Division of Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare (DAC & FW) is implementing various crop development schemes for increasing production and productivity of the crop s in the country viz. National Food Security Mission ( NFSM ) on rice, wheat, pulses ,coarse cereals and commercial crops cotton, jute & sugarcane) and Bringing Green Revolution to eastern India (BGREI ) to increase the production and productivity of ric e. NFSM NFSM -Rice is being implemented in 25 states covering 199 potential districts. Those districts have been selected which have more than 50, 000 ha area under rice and productivity is less than state average. Under NFSM, crop of production technologies are being promoted at the farmers field through organization of clusters demonstration and cropping system demonstrations, distribution of seeds which are less than 10 years old, application and INM and IPM, distribution of efficient farm machines to farmers to reduce the cost of cultivation, application of efficient use of water by using micro irrigation systems and pipes for water conveyance, training of farmers with latest crop production technologies such as timely sowing , seed rate recommended package of practices etc . For reduction in the co st of cultivation, at least 30% of the cluster demonstration under NFSM is being conducted by adopting cropping system approach to utilize the rice fallow area s for pluses and oil seeds cultivation. Assistance is given to farmers on distribution of improved seeds /hybrids , farm implements machine, irrigation devices plant protection chemicals bio pesti cides for promoting integrated pest m anagement and soil ameliorants etc. Thr ough State Government s new initiatives have been introduced such as free distribution of seed mini -kits of newer varieties of pulses , production of quality seeds (breeder , foundation and",
