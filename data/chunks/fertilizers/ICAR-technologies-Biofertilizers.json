Microorganisms play a major role in keeping soils live through its ecosystem services like solubilization of minerals, recycling of organic matter, bioremediation and soil formation. Post green revolution, self sufficiency in food grain production was achieved through the use of high yielding varieties responsive to chemical fertilizers. However, indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers has resulted in deterioration of soil health leading to shift in emphasis towards sustainable agriculture. Use of biofertilizers for nutrient management is an integral component of sustainable agriculture. Biofertilizers contain different plant associated microorganisms that enhance plant growth and improve yield and quality of the produce through supply of adequate nutrients. Nitrogen fixers, P-solubilizers and mobilizers are the traditionally known biofertilizers. With the advancement of science, new groups of biofertilizers kept on adding to the list, a few to name are K-solubilizers, Zn-solubilizers and consortia supplying different nutrients. In addition to supply of nutrients to crop",
  "plants, many of these microbes help the plants to tolerate abiotic stresses. Indian Council of Agricultural Research recognized the importance of Biofertilizers and started AICRP on Biological Nitrogen fixation in 1976, which was renamed as All India Network Project on Soil Biodiversity-Biofertilizers in 2008. These coordinated projects and the constituent institutes of ICAR have developed a large number of biofertilizers for different field and horticultural crops. In 2014, the Govt. of India initiated National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) where use of biofertilizers is being promoted to improve soil health. Though a lot of efforts have been made on the development ivand popularization of biofertilizers, the usage of biofertilizers is not at the expected level. The distribution of production and usage across the country is also skewed with south zone dominating both in terms of production and consumption of biofertilizers. Popularization of biofertilizers developed by ICAR is the immediate concern. This compendium entitled \u201cICAR Technologies: Biofertilizers for Sustainable Crop Production\u201d is a compilation of validated biofertilizers developed by constituent ICAR institutes over the decades. I am hopeful that this publication would be useful for researchers, scientists, students and other stakeholders interested in this area. It would also help to popularize the biofertilizer technologies developed by ICAR. Dated: 30 th July, 2021 (T. Mohapatra) New Delhi vpREFacE Indian Council of Agricultural Research is the leader of agricultural research in India developing a large number of technologies adopted by farmers and other stakeholders. This has led to increased crop productivity in almost all the crops so that demands of a growing population are met adequately. The growth in agricultural production in the last few decades has been accompanied by a sharp increase in the use of chemical fertilizers, causing serious concern. Foremost among these concerns is the effect of excessive fertilizers on the quality of soil and ground water. As a consequence the soil health is compromised for productivity and over a period our soils are made sick with reduced fertility and eroded biodiversity. The use of environmental friendly biofertilizers can cut down the use of chemical fertilizers. Biofetilizers are the products",
  "containing living cells of different types of microorganisms that enrich the nutrient quality of soil. Bacteria, fungi and cyanobacteria (blue green algae) are considered as the potential candidates to be used as biofertilizers. Most biofertilizers belong to one of the following categories: nitrogen fixing; phosphate, potash and zinc solubilizing and mobilizing, and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria. The Gazette of India in its notification in April, 2014 also made provision for the production of microbial consortium. It is economical to use biofertilizers as they are a cheap source of nutrients when compared to chemical fertilizers. Biofertilizers in addition to different nutrients also provide certain growth promoting substances like hormones, vitamins, and amino acids that improve the plant health and vigour. Keeping pace with the biofertilizer industry, several Institutes of ICAR have developed biofertilizer technologies which have been validated under on-farm or multi-location trials. This compendium \u201cICAR Technologies: Biofertilizers for Sustainable Crop Production\u201d is an intensive compilation and reflects the great efforts made by the scientists across various institutes to develop the technologies. viWith great pleasure I extend my sincere thanks to Dr. T. Mohapatra, Hon'ble Secretary, Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE) and Director General, ICAR, for insight, guidance and support in preparation of this compendium. I also thank the developers of biofertilizer technologies for their innovations and contributions. My appreciations are due to my colleagues at the Council and ICAR-NBAIM for bringing out this compendium which will help in shaping Indian Agriculture more sustainable. (T.R.

CIARI-GroPro 41INTR oDucTI oN Microorganisms, as an important driver of biogeochemical cycles, play a key role in soil fertility and nutrient uptake by plants. Biofertilizers include nitrogen fixing, phosphate, potassium and zinc solubilising; nutrient mobilizing microorganisms used for application to seed or soil. The manipulation of rhizosphere of plants leads to increase in numbers of such microorganisms and thereby accelerate the microbial processes which augment the availability of nutrients that can be assimilated by plants. Biofertilizers are economical and ecofriendly alternative of chemical fertilizers. Integrated nutrient management (INM) considers biofertilizers as an important component and advocates judicious application of fertilizers along with organic manures and biofertilizers which is imperative to sustain crop production and maintenance of soil health in the long term. Rhizosphere bacteria that favourably influence plant growth and yield of crop plants are designated as plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). They not only influence plant growth but also help the plants to overcome abiotic and biotic stresses. In India, biofertilizer industry has developed over years and many significant changes have taken place. The shift from carrier based to liquid formulations, inclusion of microbial consortium in Fertilizer Control Order (FCO), increase in numbers of efficient strains have led to the surge in production of biofertilizers. ICAR is continuously striving to develop quality assured biofertilizers using efficient and competitive strains. This bulletin is a compilation of 41 biofertilizer technologies developed by ICAR that are at different stages of commercialization. ixxabbreviations AICRP All India Coordinated Research Project ATARI Agricultural Technology Application Research Institute CAZRI Central Arid Zone Research Institute CCARI Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute CCC Cyanobacterial Culture Collection CCSRI C C Shroff Research Institute cfu Colony Forming Unit CIARI Central Island Agricultural",
