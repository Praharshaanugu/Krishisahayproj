  "TEACHER'S MANUAL FOR SOIL HEALTH ASSESSMENT PROGRAM About the Document Soil is a crucial and necessary foundation for plant growth and is a supremely important resource for our country. More than 54% of our workforce either directly depends on agriculture for their livelihood, or through allied activities. Therefore, the health of soil affects more than 54% of our workforce! Soil health is fundamental to the food system in the country. It forms the bedroc k of agriculture and serves as the vital medium for the growth of food -producing plants. When soils are healthy, they yield higher productivity of nutritious crops that provide nourishment for both humans and animals. It's important to recognize that the q uality and quantity of our food are directly connected to the quality of our soils. Therefore, prioritising soil health is essential for ensuring the availability of high -quality and abundant food for all and reducing dependency on other countries for agri cultural produce. The Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emphasised the importance of teaching students the importance of soil and its health. He has also called for senior secondary students to be trained and involved in doing soil tests to suppo rt farmers to the extent possible. This would be done by utilising school laboratories. In light of this, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, the Ministry of Education, the Central Board of Secondary Education have partnered to create and curate this resource for students and teachers to be apprised of the importance of soil health and testing. This document provides teachers with information about soil, its importance in our society, its various functions and types, along with the significan ce of teaching students about soil health. This document aims to equip teachers with the knowledge about soil health and measures to improve it such that they may impart it to their students and support the efforts of soil testing to help our nation's farm ers.

Soil provides the structural support to plants for growing crops under agriculture lands and is their source of water and nutrients . Soils varies in their chemical and physical properties. Processes such as lea ching, weathering and microbial activity combine to make a whole range of different soil types . Composition of soil: The arrangement and distribution of soil components vary as per soil types. There are mainly four types of soil : 12 Twelve major soil texture classifications are defined by the United States, Department of Agriculture as shown alongside \u2013 Percent p roportions of sand, silt and clay will determine the type of textural classes. Importance of Soil s to Agriculture \u2022 Agriculture is one of the most important economic components of our society. \u2022 Soil being finite in nature and precious resource for agriculture as it provides the structural support to crops in agriculture and is also their source of water and nutrients in nearly 45.27% percent of reported geographic area under agriculture in the country ( 140 million ha) in the country. \u2022 India hugely depends on agriculture for its economy which support livelihood of 50% population. \u2022 Agriculture sector employs over 50% of the total workforce in the country and Responsible for 20% of the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product Value. \u2022 Healthy soil plays a critical in successful agriculture in terms of providing foods; fodder with environmental benefits of biodiversity and carbon storage required for effective functioning of ecosystem services and is the original source of the nutrients that we use to grow crops 13 \u2022 Soil being finite in nature and requires 200 -400 years to develop 1cm of soil layer.

This retur ns the nutrients to the soil. 14 Chapter 3: Issues of Soil Health Basics of Soil health Soil health corresponds to the state of the soil being in sound physical, chemical, and biological condition, having the capability to sustain the growth and development of land plants. It is the sustained ability of soil to produce crops and supply, retention and infiltration of water, habitat for diverse organisms, and recycling of nutrients. In the recent past, s oil health is continuing to gain importance am ong farmers, scientists and planners world over for implementation of programs on sustainable agriculture development. While awareness of soil health is increasing, it is important to have a good understanding of what soil health, how it is measured, and h ow to manage it for optimal and sustainable delivery of the ecosystem services that soils provide. Just as we can take differ ent measurement to judge a person \u2019s health, it is also possible to measur e specific soil properties to detect whether a soil is healthy or not. Such measurements may be quantitativ e or qualitative, or a combination of both. In India presently under Soil Health Card Scheme 12 parameters are measured. They are Soil primary nutrients (N, P, K), Soil Seconda ry nutrients (S), Soil micronutrients (Zn, Fe, CU, Mn, B), Soil salinity (EC), Soil pH and Soil Organic Carbon. The critical situation of soil health status with respect to agriculture 15 The critical situation of soil health status with respect to agriculture is a significant concern worldwide. Here are some details regarding this issue: 1. Soil Degradation: Soil degradation is a primary concern affecting soil health. Factors such as erosion, nutrient depletion, compaction, salinization, and acidification contribute to the deterioration of soil quality. Unsustainable agricultural practices, defore station, urbanization, and climate change exacerbate these issues. 2. Nutrient Depletion: Continuous cultivation without adequate nutrient replenishment can lead to nutrient depletion in the soil. Nutrients essential for plant growth, such as nitrogen, ph osphorus, and potassium, are gradually depleted, resulting in reduced crop yields. Inadequate nutrient management, excessive use of",

Unsustainable agricultural practices, defore station, urbanization, and climate change exacerbate these issues. 2. Nutrient Depletion: Continuous cultivation without adequate nutrient replenishment can lead to nutrient depletion in the soil. Nutrients essential for plant growth, such as nitrogen, ph osphorus, and potassium, are gradually depleted, resulting in reduced crop yields. Inadequate nutrient management, excessive use of synthetic fertilizers, and poor organic matter management contribute to this problem. 3. Acidification and Salinization: When soil pH dropping below optimal levels for plant growth. Acidification can result from excessive use of chemical fertilizers, acid rain etc. Whereas s alinization occurs when the salt content in the soil increases to harmful levels due o ver-irrigation, po or drainage, and the use of low -quality water sources . It reduces the availability of water to plants and negatively affects their growth and productivity. 4. Loss of Organic Matter: Organic matter provides essential nutrients, improves soil structure, an d enhances moisture retention capacity. However, unsustainable farming practices, including excessive tillage, removal of crop residues, and lack of organic inputs, lead to a decline in organic matter content. Loss of organic matter reduces soil fertility and resilience. 5. Pollution and Contamination: Agricultural activities often involve the use of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. Improper application and excessive use of these chemicals can result in soil pollution and contamination. Chemical re sidues in the soil can harm soil organisms, beneficial insects, and potentially enter the food chain, posing risks to human health and the environment. 16 Addressing these critical issues requires implementing sustainable agricultural practices, such as conservation tillage, crop rotation, agroforestry, cover cropping, and precision agriculture. These practices aim to minimize soil erosion, promote nutrient cycling, enhance soil structure, and reduce chemical inputs, thereby improving soil health and ensu ring long -term agricultural sustainability. Present day challenges of Soil health and Fertility Soil fertility is inherent ability of soils to provide nutrient to plants in available forms. It is a fundamental aspect of soil health.

  "Present day challenges of Soil health and Fertility Soil fertility is inherent ability of soils to provide nutrient to plants in available forms. It is a fundamental aspect of soil health. Together significance of soil fertility and soil health for sustainable agriculture lies in its ability to support resilient and productive cropping systems while preserving natural resources. By focusing on soil fertility farmer can improve soil health, and their crop yields, improve the nutritiona l quality of their produce, reduce environmental impacts, and contribute to a more sustainable and resilient food system . Today , Soil health being compromised due following factors The imbalance in the use of fertilizers The use of fertilizers and its impact on Indian soils is a significant concern that affects soil health and agricultural sustainability in following way. 1. Excessive Use of Chemical Fertilizers: In India, there has been a tendency towards excessive and i mbalanced use of chemical fertilizers, particularly nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Farmers often apply fertilizers based on crop yield targets without considering the soil's nutrient requirements for crop . This imbalanced application lead s to nutrient overdosing in the soil. 2. Nutrient Imbalance: The excessive use of chemical fertilizers, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, while neglecting other essential nutrients, causes nutrient imbalances in the soil. Imbalances can result in defici encies or toxicities of certain nutrients, negatively affecting crop growth and yield. Over time, these imbalances lead to soil degradation and reduced fertility. 3. Soil Degradation and Reduced Fertility: The imbalanced use of fertilizers contributes to soil degradation and reduced fertility. Excessive nitrogen application can lead to 17 nutrient leaching, as well as the loss of soil organic matter. Phosphorus overuse can result in phosphorus fixation, making it less available to plants. These factors collec tively degrade soil quality, decrease nutrient -holding capacity, and reduce overall soil fertility. 4. Environmental Impact: The excessive use of chemical fertilizers in India has environmental consequences beyond soil degradation. Manufacturing and trans portation of fertilizers contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and energy consumption. Furthermore, the pollution caused by nutrient runoff from agricultural fields affects water quality and aquatic ecosystems, impacting biodiversity and h uman health. 5. Addressing the imbalance in fertilizer use requires a shift towards balanced nutrient management practices.

This includes soil testing to determine nutrient requirements, adopting site -specific nutrient management (SSNM) techniques, promot ing organic farming and the use of organic fertilizers . Government policies, farmer education programs, and subsidies that promote sustainable fertilizer use and awareness about nutrient management can play a crucial role in mitigating the adverse impacts on Indian soils and fostering sustainable agriculture. Impact of Human interference on soil health Human interference has a significant impact on soil health and can lead to various forms of soil degradation. Here are some ways in which human acti vities affect soil: 1. Deforestation: Clearing forests for agriculture, urbanization, or urban planning disrupts the natural ecosystem and exposes the soil to erosion. Tree roots help bind the soil together, and their removal increases the risk of soil er osion, leading to loss of topsoil and decreased fertility. 2. Unsustainable Agriculture Practices: Intensive and unsustainable agricultural practices contribute to soil degradation. Excessive tillage, overuse of chemical 18 fertilizers and pesticides, monocr opping, and improper flood irrigation can lead to soil erosion, nutrient depletion, compaction, and loss of organic matter. 3. Urbanization and Construction: Urban development involves clearing land, compacting soil, and covering it with impermeable surfaces such as concrete and asphalt. This reduces soil's ability to absorb and retain water, disrupts natural drainage patterns, and reduces soil fertility. 4. Industrial Activities and Pollution: Industrial activities release pollutants int o the environment, including heavy metals, chemicals, and toxins. These pollutants can contaminate the soil, making it unsuitable for agriculture. Industrial waste disposal, improper handling of hazardous materials, and industrial accidents can lead to soi l pollution. 5. Improper Waste Disposal: Improper disposal of solid waste, including plastics, heavy metals, and organic waste, can lead to soil pollution. Landfills and waste disposal sites that are not properly designed and managed can contaminate the surrounding soil, groundwater, and ecosystems. 6. Climate Change: Human -induced climate change, primarily through increased greenhouse gas emissions, affects soil health.

Climate Change: Human -induced climate change, primarily through increased greenhouse gas emissions, affects soil health. Rising temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events can intensify soil erosion, alter nutrient cycles, and impact microbial activity in the soil. To mitigate the negative impacts of human interference on soil, sustainable land management practices need to be adopted. These include conservati on agriculture, agroforestry, organic farming, proper waste management, reforestation, erosion control measures, and responsible land -use planning. Additionally, educating and raising awareness among individuals, farmers, and industries about the importanc e of soil conservation and sustainable practices can help preserve soil health for future generations. 19 Chapter 4: Soil fertility indicators and soil Health in agriculture The soil fertility attributes or indicators are interconnected and their status in soils positively and negatively impacts the functioning within the soil -plant system. They collectively contribute to the overall health and productivity of the soil. Understanding of these attributes are vital for s ustainable agriculture, as they help optimize nutrient availability, promote plant growth, and support environmental stewardship. Soil health assessment incorporating these attributes enables farmers to make informed decisions regarding soil management pra ctices, nutrient application, and crop rotation, ultimately contributing to sustainable agricultural systems. Percent soil Organic Carbon: \u2022 Organic carbon is a measure of the amount of organic matter present in the soil. It originates from decomposed plant and animal residues. \u2022 Organic carbon contributes to soil health by enhancing soil structure, water - holding capacity, and nutrient cycling. It promotes beneficial microbial activity. \u2022 Adequate organic carbon content is essential for support ing plant growth, nutrient availability, and overall soil health . Soil pH \u2022 Soil pH is a measure of soil acidity or alkalinity. It influences nutrient availability and microbial activity in the soil. \u2022 Different plants have different pH preferences, and soil pH affects nutrient solubility and uptake by plant roots. \u2022 Maintaining the appropriate soil pH range for specific crops helps optimize nutrient availability and prevents nutrient deficiencies or toxicities. 20 Electrical Conductivity (EC) \u2022 EC is a measure of the soil's ability to conduct electrical current",

Available Nutrients \u2022 Soil nutrients, including macro - and micronutrients, are essential for plant growth a nd development. \u2022 Nutrient availability in the soil depends on factors such as organic matter decomposition, pH, and nutrient cycling processes. \u2022 Adequate nutrient levels are crucial for plant growth, productivity, and overall crop quality. \u2022 Soil testing and analysis help determine the levels of available nutrients, enabling farmers to adjust fertilization practices and address nutrient imbalances There and major and micro nutrients based on its quantitative requirement are been categorised and th ese are as under : Major nutrients a) Nitrogen (N): Nitrogen is essential for plant growth and plays a vital role in protein synthesis, leaf development, and overall plant vigour . However, excessive nitrogen use can lead to environmental issues such as water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. 21 b) Phosphorus (P): Phosphorus is crucial for energy transfer, root development, and fruiting in plants. Phosphorus availability in the soil supports healthy crop establishment, enhances root growth, and improves crop quality. c) Potassium (K): Potassium is involved in numerous physiological processes in plants, including enzyme activation, and nutrient transport. It contributes to disease resistance, water use efficiency, and enhances tolerance to stress conditions . Micronutrients a) Iron (Fe): Iron is crucial for chlorophyll synthesis and plays a key role in photosynthesis and energy production in plants . Iron deficiency can lead to yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) and reduced crop productivity. b) Zinc (Zn): Zinc is involved in various enzyme activities and plays a critical role in plant hormone production, protein synthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism. Zinc deficiency can lead to stunted growth, reduced yields,",

Micronutrients a) Iron (Fe): Iron is crucial for chlorophyll synthesis and plays a key role in photosynthesis and energy production in plants . Iron deficiency can lead to yellowing of leaves (chlorosis) and reduced crop productivity. b) Zinc (Zn): Zinc is involved in various enzyme activities and plays a critical role in plant hormone production, protein synthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism. Zinc deficiency can lead to stunted growth, reduced yields, and impaired nutrient uptake. c) Manganese (Mn): Mangane se is essential for photosynthesis, enzyme activation, and nitrogen metabolism in plants. Manganese deficiency can lead to yellowing between veins (interveinal chlorosis) and reduced crop yields. d) Copper (Cu): Copper is involved in several metabolic proce sses, including photosynthesis, respiration, and lignin synthesis. It contributes to plant reproductive development, disease resistance, and enzyme activity. Copper deficiency can result in wilting, leaf deformities, and reduced crop yields. Similarly, fertile soil contains an optimal balance of essential nutrients necessary for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients. Maintaining soil fertility is essential to support healthy crop development, high yields, and nutrient -rich food production. 22 Chapter 5: Objectives of Soil Health Program The objective of a student awareness program on soil health assessment using farmer soil testing and laboratory analysis program may aim to achieve: 1.

SHC enables the farmers to apply recommended doses of nutrients based on soil test values to realize improved and sustainable soil health and fertility, low cos ts and higher profits. 26 SOPs for Soil Sampling & Processing of Sample for Testing When to Sample? Timing of sampling is important because soil properties vary depending on the time of year and type of management practices used, such as tillage or nutrient application just prior to testing. The best time of year to sample is when the climate is most stable and there have been no recent disturbances, such as after harvesting or at the end of the growing season. Where to Sample? 1. For sampling of micronutrient analysis, always use auger made up of stainless steel instead of rusted iron khurpi or spade. 2. Store soil samples in clean cloth or polythene bags. 3. Use glass or polythene jars for storage of soil samples for a longer duration. 4. Recently fertilized plots, bunds, channels, marshy tracts, area near trees, farm ways, buildings, wells, compost piles or other non -representative locations must be avoided during sampling.

Deep rooted crops with longer duration (Cotton, sugarcane, banana, tapioca, vegetables etc.) Plantation or fruit crops Samples should be collected from different depth depending on situation 28 Grid sampling allows for a systematic, non-random , approach to soil sampling which can be applied on a whole or for sampling relatively smaller areas. It allows for a higher degree of precision where repeat samples are collected over time. Zig-zag sampling provides the best coverage of an area if care is taken with the sample collection. This is often the best strategy for collecting samples to diagnose nutrient deficiencies. V-shaped soil sampling (15 cm soil sampling depth) Procedure of V shaped method of soil sampling: 1.Remove the surface litter, grass, debris, etc., from the sampling point 2.Drive the auger to a plough depth of 15 cm and draw the soil sample 3.Collect at least 10 to 15 samples from each sampling unit and p lace in a bucket or tray 4.If auger is not available, make a \u2018V\u2019 shaped cut to a depth of 15 cm in the sampling spot using spade 5. Remove thick slice of soil from top to bottom of exposed face (2.5 -3 cm) of the \u2018V\u2019 shaped cut and place in a clean container. Preparation of composite soil sample 1. Mix the collected soil samples thoroughly on a clean sheet. 2. Entire soil mass is spread 3. Divide into four quarters 29 4. Two opposite samples are discarded and remaining two are remixed.

Remove plant residues, gravels, etc by retaining them on the sieve. Do's and Don'ts for soil sampling, processing & testing in Indian conditions: Do's: 1. Use a representative sampling method: Take multiple soil samples from different locations within the field to account for soil variability. Use a zigzag or W-pattern sampling approach to obtain a representative soil sample. 2. Sample at the right time: Soil sampling should ideally be done before the planting season or during the fallow period. 3. Take samples at the appropriate depth: The depth of soil sampling depends on the crop and its root zone. For most crops, a depth of 0 -15 cm is suitable. However, for deeper -rooted crops like sugarcane or tree plantations, sample up to 30 -60 cm depth or as recommended. Drying Grinding Sieving 31 4. Use clean sampling tools: Ensure that sampling tools such as a soil probe, auger, or shovel are clean and free from contaminants to prevent cross - contamination . 5. Label samples properly: Clearly label each soil sample with unique identifiers, including location, date , depth, and crop information. This helps in maintaining proper records and ensures correct interpretation of test results. 6. Store and handle samples correctly: Store soil samples in clean, labelled sample bags or containers to avoid mixing or contaminatio n. Keep samples in a cool, dry place until they are sent for testing. Don'ts: 1. Don't sample from atypical areas: Avoid sampling from areas with known soil variability, such as eroded spots, waterlogged areas, or areas near boundaries where different management practices may have been followed. 2. Don't sample immediately after fertili zer application: Wait for a sufficient period after fertilization to allow nutrients to mix uniformly in the soil. Sampling immediately after fertilization may result in inaccurate nutrient readings. 3. Don't use non -representative sampling tools: Avoid usin g galvanized or",

Don't sample from atypical areas: Avoid sampling from areas with known soil variability, such as eroded spots, waterlogged areas, or areas near boundaries where different management practices may have been followed. 2. Don't sample immediately after fertili zer application: Wait for a sufficient period after fertilization to allow nutrients to mix uniformly in the soil. Sampling immediately after fertilization may result in inaccurate nutrient readings. 3. Don't use non -representative sampling tools: Avoid usin g galvanized or rusty tools. These can affect the accuracy of the test results. 4. Don't sample from surface residues: Do not collect samples from areas with high surface residues. Remove surface residues from sample . 5. Don't rely solely on visual assessment: Visual soil assessments may provide some indications of soil health, but they cannot accurately determine nutrient deficiencies or imbalances. Soil testing is essential to obtain precise information for making nutrient management decisions. By adhering to these do's and don'ts, farmers, agronomists, and researchers can obt ain reliable soil test results. 32 Soil Testing & Analysis Soil testing is a set of various chemical processes that determine the amount of available plant nutrients in the soil. It is important because it determines the exact amount of available crop nutrients in the soil and provides a visible snapshot of soil properties (chemical/ physical/ biological). The results of soil testing will supply soil nutrients interpretation , which includes an indication of whether that particular soil is low, medium or high/ deficient or sufficient in that nutrient. Accordingly, fertilizer recommendations based on the analysis can be made.

The interpretation of soil test results will typically indicate whether a nutrient level is \u2013 Low or (in case of macro - nutrients) Deficient or (in case of micro - nutrients) Medium (moderate) or (in case of macro - nutrients) Sufficient (in case of micro - nutrients) High (adequate)/ Very high (in case of macro - nutrients) High Acidity/ Alkalinity (in case of soil pH) These levels are known as \u201cnutrient classes\u201d or categories. The nutrient classes or categories used in Digital Soil Testing Mini Lab for 12 soil health parameters are as given below - Soil pH pH range Classes <4 Extremely acid 4-5 Strongly acid 5-6 Moderately acid 6-7 Slightly acid 7 Neutral 7-8 Moderately alkaline >8.5 Strongly alkaline 52 Soils are not happy in High Acidity/ Alkalinity conditions. Because it indicates the major nutrient deficiencies in soils (in high acidic soils) and trace element deficiencies along affecting other soil prop erties in soils (in high alkaline soils). Soil EC EC range of extract (dS/m) Salt (%) range in soil Classes 0-0.4 0-0.05 Non saline (Salinity effect mostly negligible) 0.4-0.8 0.05-0.1 Very slightly saline (Yield of very sensitive crops may be restricted) 0.8-1.6 0.1-0.2 Moderately saline (Yield of many crops restricted) >1.6 >0.2 Strongly saline (Only tolerant crops yield satisfactorily) NOTE - Alluvial soil (silt loam) = soil: water is 1:2; Black soil (clay loam)= soil: water is 1:5 Soils are not happy in Salinity conditions. Because it affects the growth of plants. Soil Organic Carbon (OC) OC range (%) Classes <0.5 Low 0.5",

Because these are essential nutrients for plant growth. 54 Sulphur Sulphur (ppm) Classes <10 Deficient >10 Sufficient Micro -nutrients, i.e., Zinc, Iron, Copper, Manganese, Boron Soils are very happy when Macro as well as Micro nutrients are high/ sufficient in soils. Because plants need these are essential nutrients from soils for its growth.
