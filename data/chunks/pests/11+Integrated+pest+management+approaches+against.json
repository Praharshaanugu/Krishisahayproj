  "January\u2013February 2023 39 VeGeTaBleS play a major role in indian agriculture as they ensure the food and nutritional security of the country apart from enhancing per capita income of the farmers. Globally, india ranks second in vegetable production and contributes 16.70% to the global vegetable area and 15.40% to production. T omato, brinjal, cabbage, cauliflower, okra, beans and cucurbits are important vegetables cultivated in i ndia. among different vegetables grown in the country, tomato ranks third in priority after potato and onion. T omato ( Lycopersicon esculentum l.; Family Solanaceae) is one of the most important vegetable crops of india. T omato is grown in a wide range of climatic conditions across different states of i ndia. The major tomato producing states in the country are Madhya Pradesh, andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Tamil n adu, Bihar, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and T elangana. These states account for about 90% of the total production in the country. insect pests and diseases are biotic constraints to tomato production. any part of the tomato plant may be affected by insect pests and diseases, thereby playing a significant role in determining quantity and quality of harvest. The important pests which are found to be severe menace in tomato production are given in Table1. Economic loss due to pests in tomato in recent past, with changes in the cropping pattern, ecosystems and habitat, climate and wider use of high input intensive vegetable varieties/hybrids, there has been a paradigm shift in infestation of pests in time and space. These pests cause huge losses depending upon the integrated pest management approaches against major insect pests and diseases of tomatoRaghavendra K V* Rekha Balodi and Subhash Chander infestation severity. if we look at the severity of damage, tomato fruit borer (H. armigera) alone causes 85-93.7% loss South american tomato pinworm (Tuta absoluta,) 60.08% to 82.31%; e arly blight (Alternaria solani ) up to 78%; Wilt ( Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Lycopersici) 10-60%; Begomoviruses 100%; root knot nematode ( Meloidogyne spp) 27 .2% damage to tomato. Need for integrated approaches Management of these pests needs a comprehensive approach by integrating all ecologically feasible methods in crop protection.

  "Wilt ( Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Lycopersici) 10-60%; Begomoviruses 100%; root knot nematode ( Meloidogyne spp) 27 .2% damage to tomato. Need for integrated approaches Management of these pests needs a comprehensive approach by integrating all ecologically feasible methods in crop protection. Farmers use pesticides as first line of defense and frequently resort to indiscriminate and non-judicious use of pesticides. From the base line survey conducted by iCar\u2013 nCiPM, new Delhi, it was found that, farmers spray 25-30 rounds of cocktail chemical pesticides in a season. The major investment in tomato crop production was thus for plant protection activities and they spend nearly up to one lakh rupees for plant protection measures per season, which ultimately increases the cost of production. However literature states that pesticide application often exceeded 50 sprays per tomato crop season in south i ndia. Due to scarcity of information and lack of knowledge among the farmers about the recommended pesticides, dosage, safe harvest interval, label claim and personnel protection during spray operation, farmers go for indiscreet use of chemical pesticides which leads to several problems such as environmental pollution, pesticide residue in the harvested products, development of resistance/resurgence in pests, emergence of new pests, destruction of natural enemies and pollinators, and increased cost of production. in Research Tomato is one of the most important vegetable crops of i ndia, grown in 789.20 thousand ha area with 25.00 mt/ha productivity. Pests and diseases are biotic constraints to tomato production. in recent past, due to climate variability coupled with changes in the cropping pattern, there has been a paradigm shift in infestation of pests in time and space, causing huge losses. According to base line survey conducted by iCAR\u2013NC iPM, New Delhi, farmers spray 25-30 rounds of cocktail chemical pesticides in a season, leading to various adverse effects. The only alternative to overcome the problems due to sole dependence on pesticides is to adopt integrated Pest Management ( iPM) practices as explained in this article. Besides guiding the farmers to reduce the over-reliance upon chemical pesticides, this will help them to grow tomatoes according to Good Agriculture Practices (GAP) standards.Indian Horticulture 40this circumstance, a paradigm shift in pest management approaches is the need of the hour and this can be effectively achieved through rationalization of pesticide use and integration of several eco-friendly approaches to minimize over-reliance on pesticides.

Besides guiding the farmers to reduce the over-reliance upon chemical pesticides, this will help them to grow tomatoes according to Good Agriculture Practices (GAP) standards.Indian Horticulture 40this circumstance, a paradigm shift in pest management approaches is the need of the hour and this can be effectively achieved through rationalization of pesticide use and integration of several eco-friendly approaches to minimize over-reliance on pesticides. Importance of Integrated Pest Management strategies in tomato production, farmers practice calendar based application of pesticides. This has become a common practice over the years by most of the farmers growing tomatoes in almost all the states. it is in this contexts integrated Pest Management ( iPM) can play a major role in judicious use of pesticides, reducing cost of production and increased crop yield. integrated Pest Management (i PM) means the careful consideration of all available pest control techniques and subsequent integration of appropriate measures that discourage the development of pest populations and keep pesticides and other interventions to levels that are economically justified and reduce or minimize risks to human health and/or the environment. integrated pest management (i PM) practices consisting of growing resistant/tolerant varieties/hybrids/genotypes, cultural practices, mechanical practices, bio-control agents, botanicals and chemical pesticides (with appropriate dose and time of application) in an integrated manner to manage the pests and diseases will not only help the farmers to reduce the over-reliance upon chemical pesticides, but also help them to grow the tomatoes according to Good agriculture Practices (GaP) standards, which in turn attracts foreign export as well as domestic consumption and as number of insecticide sprays are reduced, the cost of production will also be reduced. iPM is not only cost effective but also economically and ecologically feasible and can be well accepted by the farming community.

Damage symptoms of major insect pests and diseases in Tomato IPM interventions in Tomato iPM technology in tomato was done by i Car \u2013 nCiPM, n ew Delhi in collaboration with Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Chintamani, University of agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru through farmers\u2019 participatory approach (FP a) at Brahmanaradinne and Mudachintalahalli village of Chintamani taluk, Chikballapura district, Karnataka and at Padhana village of Karnal district, Haryana (area coverage \u2013 iPM 10 a c i.e. 10 farmers of 1 a c each and n on-iPM 5 ac i.e. 5 farmers of 1 a c each) during 2020-2021. The critical i PM inputs were provided to the selected i PM farmers and the i PM technology in tomato is being compared with the farmer\u2019s practices. The main intention of iPM approaches in tomato is to promote need based application of pesticide spray, instead of calendar based and maintaining the productivity of the crop. in addition, awareness is being created through series of farmer field schools (FFS) among the farming community about the adoption and advantages of i PM technology in sustainable vegetable production. SUMMARY Due to i PM interventions in tomato, we succeeded in changing the farmers\u2019 attitude towards need based pesticide application instead of practicing calendar based pesticide application, without hampering the productivity of the crop. The i PM approach in tomato resulted in reducing the total number of pesticide applications to 8-10 sprays instead of 20-24 sprays per season. The awareness created through series of farmer field schools (FFS) among the farming community about importance of iPM technology in sustainable vegetable production has also promoted adoption of Good agricultural Practices (GaP) by the farmers, through which they were able to produce residue free tomatoes and other vegetables for the market.
