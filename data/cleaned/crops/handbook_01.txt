-6-Classification of Seed
Breeder seed: Kept by breeder or breeding institute.
Foundation seed: Multiplied from breeder seeds at research station etc.Registered seed: Seed produced by a seed center / company.Certified seed: Seed growen in seed grower's field.
Seed Dormancy
Dormancy can prevent ge rmination of grains on
the panicle when panicles are submerged.
Dormancy period: 0 ～8w e e k s
Breaking dormancy: heat 50 ℃for 4-5 days.
(Do not close up the container of seeds )
Practical method: dry on the concrete floor for
2-3 days
Germination
When the tip of coleoptile emerges from seed.
Imbibition stage → Activation stage → Post germination growth stage
0-18 hours 18 -72 hours 72 hours →( at 20℃)
When moisture content of seed is 30-40 % germination commences.
Lower than 8 ℃and more than 45 ℃no germination
Seedling Emergence
Tip of the seedling emerges from the soil.
Temperature
・Optimum temperature for seedling emergence is 25 - 30 ℃.
・Higher than 40 ℃seedlings die.
・Lower than 10 ℃ seedlings can not grow.
Oxygen
Growth of seedlings need 5-6 ppm oxygen.Lack of oxygen: Root growth is poor and
coleoptile shows abnormal elongation.
left: under enough O2
right: under lack of O2
-7-Rice Growth Stage
Vegetative growth: Germination →Panicle initiation 60 days
Reproductive growth: Panicle initiation → Heading 30 days
Heading → Maturity 30 days
(milky→dough→ yellow ripe → maturity)
Germination Test
Before sowing, a germination test should be done to ensure 80% germination.
The following procedure should be used;
If the germination percentage is lower than 80%, then use a higher seed rate.
①② ③
Count 100 seeds Soak seeds for 24 hours Wrap in wet paper
⑥⑤ ④
Count the number of seeds 2 days after incubation Incubate for 2 days
Seed Selection at Planting
It is difficult to determine seed viability with
the naked eye. It is advisable to carry out
seed selection using the floatation method.Separate sunken seeds (filled grain) with high
potential to germinate from those that float (empty
grain) that are unable to germinate.
-8-Seed Production
Since rice is self-pollinated plant, r ice seed can be produced by yourself.
R i c es e e dc a nb ep r o d u c e db yt h ef a r m e r s

Purification through remo val of off-types ensures uniformity in growth and
stability of yields of rice.
-9-UPLAND RICE CULTIVATION
Upland Rice Varieties
NARO/NaCRRI has released 5 Upland Rice Varieties being grown by farmers.
They are more superior to the previous variety Abilony(IRAT 112 ).
NARIC 1 (ITA 257): Maturity 115 - 120 days Yield 3.5- 4 t / ha
NARIC 2 (ITA 325): Maturity 115 - 120 days Yield 3 - 3.5 t / ha

This variety is also known as SUPARICA 2
NERICA 1 : Maturity 105- 115 days. Yield 3 -4t/h a w i t h aroma .
NERICA 10 : Maturity 100 - 105 days Yield 3 -4 t / ha Grain with long awn
NERICA 1 NERICA 4 NERICA 10
Note: However, yields of upland rice depend largely on the rainfall pattern and
good agronomic practices like weeding and fertilization.
What is NERICA NERICA = NEwRICef o r Africa
NERICA is the product of interspecific hybridization between the cultivated rice
species of Africa and Asia.It was developed by scientists from WARDA (Dr. Monty Jones )in the early
1990s.

-1 1-Rainfall and Fields
You have to check rainfall pattern in your area. (Please see appendix)
Upland rice grow well where 5 days total rainfall is more than 20 mm fromsowing to 15 days before harvesting (about 90 days).Field location should preferably be in the low lying areas since these areas have
more water available to sustain rice to maturity.
It is advisable to make bands around the field to avoid rain water from runningoff.

Upland NERICA perform well under paddy condition (with standing water).
Soil pH for Rice
Rice does not perform well with soil whichhas pH 7.5 or above.
Most of soil in Uganda has no problem except few area.
-1 5-Planting Methods
There are 3 methods of planting upland rice namely; Drill, Dibble, Broadcast.
Drilling and Dibbling allow straight row planting that ensures optimum plantpopulation and use of a hoe for weeding. Straight row planting can be achievedby using a planting rope or using line markers.

Sowing Depth
It is recommended that upland rice be planted at a depth of between 3 - 4 cm.
Planting at a depth of more than 5 cm has been observed to result in low
germination, delayed emergence, delayed maturity and thus low yields.

Refilling of Missing Hills
Missing hills lead to low yield. It is therefore advisable that you set a small
nursery bed beside the mother garden to raise seedlings for purposes of refilling
gaps. Gap filling should be done 15-20 days after sowing and it’s important to
water the seedlings after transplanting.
-1 9-Fertilization
Rice should not be continuously grown on the same fields, it should be rotated
with other crops to conserve soil fertility.
Composted organic material such as rice straw and animal manure can be added
to the soil to supplement soil fertility.

-2 1-LOWLAND RICE CULTIVATION
Transplanting of Rice
Advantage of transplanting method:
・Reduce weed problems.
・Planted seedlings are about 3 weeks old by the time weed seeds germinate.
・R o t a r yw e e d e rc a nb eu s e di ft r a n s p l a n t e di ns t r a i g h tr o w s .
・ Reduce lodging problem
Disadvantage of transplanting method:
・Seedbed preparation and transplanting cost/labour are needed.
Land preparation
A well-prepared field has the following advantages:
・Controls weeds and recycles nutrients through the decomposition of rice
stubble and weeds which are incorporated into the soil.
・Provide a soft soil mass for transplanting.
・Makes a hard soil layer which reduces the percolation of water, so,
minimizing the loss of fertilizer through leaching.
For good land preparation, follow these steps:
・First, repair bund to impound water in the fields.
・After repairing the bund, irrigate the fields 3 - 5 days before tilling.
・Irrigate the field and cut the bund to increase planting area.
・Bund should be narrow and small to avoid making nest of rats.
・Irrigate the field again after tilling. This hasten the decomposition of organic
materials that were incorporated with soil.
・Keep the field flooded to minimize the loss of nitrogen.
・One week after 1st tilling, puddle the fields. Puddling minimizes the loss of
water and increases nutrient retention and availability.
・Drain standing water in the field, apply basal fertilizer before final tilling to
incorporate it with the soil. This minimizes the loss of nitrogen into the air.
・Basal fertilizer application: DAP 25 kg / acre + Urea 25 kg / acre
・Level the field.
-2 2-Seed Preparation
①Floating empty grains
It is difficult to determine seed viability with
the naked eye. It is advisable to carry out
seed selection using the floatation method.
Separate sunken seeds (filled grain )with
high potential to germinate from those that
float(empty grain )that are unable to germinate.
②Soak seeds for 24 hours in clean water.
③Incubate the seeds for 30-36 hours by placing
in a sack filled to half its capacity.
Warm temperature is needed to increase the
enzymatic activities inside the seed.
Incubation keeps the seeds warm, increases
growth of the embryo, and results in uniform
germination.
But where temperature is too high, germination
rate decreases and the embryo may be killed.
Seedbed Preparation and Seedling Management (Wet Seedbed )
①Prepare seedbed plots of 1 m wide and any convenient length 1 day
before sowing.
A plot area of about 100 -150㎡is needed to sow 15 kg of seeds for one
acre.

Do not cover the soil after
sowing.
⑤Once seeds have sprouted, about
3-4 cm high, irrigate and keep shallow water level.
⑥Increase water depth gradually as seedlings grow taller.
(Do not allow seedbed surface to dry )
⑦When more than half of the leaves are damaged, apply insecticide.

⑧16 days after sowing, seedlings are ready to transplant.
When we uproot seedlings, keeping deep water in the seedbed makes iteasier to remove the mud from the seedling root.
⑨Seedlings should be transplanted before 25 days after sowing.
Transplanting of old seedlings cause low yield.

Refilling of Missing Hills
Missing hills lead to low yield. It is therefore advisable that you place extra
seedling at the corner of the field to be used for replanting.
Replant missing hills 10 days after transplanting.

-2 7-HARVESTING AND POST HARVEST
Harvesting
The stem of the rice is cut close to the ground by serrated sickles. This method
of harvesting is much faster than harvesting by panicle using a knife. Harvesting
should be done when 80-85% of the grains are straw coloured and the grains in
the lower part of the panicle are in the hard dough stage.
Harvesting by sickles Harvesting panicles by knife
Threshing
Threshing can be done by beating with sticks against a log or using thresher.
However, threshing by beating increases the chances of broken grains at milling.
Beating with sticks After beating, many paddy are remained
-2 8-Two types of thresher are are available in Kampala.
Manual thresher Engine driven thresher
Winnowing and Drying
Before drying, winnow empty grains
and straw away.
Open air drying under the hot sun heat
is widely practiced in the tropics.
Preferably drying should be done on
a tarpaulin or a clean drying floorfree of stones.
The rice should be 4 - 5 cm thick and needs to be turned over 30-60 minutes to
allow equal exposure to the sun heat. Its important to monitor moisturereductions, less than 3% reductions are recommended per day.
Rapid drying lead to broken rice when milling. DRY SLOWLY!
Keep 4-5 cm thickness for sun dry Rapid drying cause broken rice

-3 0-SOIL MANAGEMENT
Fertilizer
Fertilizers (inorganic or organic )contain nutrients needed by the rice plant.
The soil sometimes does not provide sufficient nutrients needed by the riceplant, hence, the need to apply fertilizer.
There are several nutrients needed by the rice plant but nitrogen (N),
phosphorus (P), and potassium (K)are needed in large amounts.
These nutrients must therefore be constantly replenished to sustain the growthof rice plant.
Symptoms due to deficiency of elements in the soil
N:Early growth retarded.Tillering reduced.
Leaf color: yellow-green from lower to upper leaves.
Flowering and ripening accelerated.P:Early growth retarded.
Tillering reduced.
Leaf color: dark green, mixed with red, purple.K:Early growth retarded.
Leaf color: yellowing interveinal zone from top to lower.

of spreading human disease.-3 3-PLANT PROTECTION
Weed Management
Weeds reduce rice yields by competing with the rice plants for soil nutrients,
moisture, and sunlight.
Fertilizer application may not increase yield in weedy fields because weeds
absorb nutrients more effectively than the rice plants.
Weeds are also harmful because they may be alternate hosts for insects and
diseases of rice, and provide shelter for rats.
Weed control measure that you can use are the preventive, mechanical, cultural,
and chemical method.
・The preventive method includes use of good seeds (without weed seeds ),
control of weeds before flowering and keep bund and canals free of weeds.
・The mechanical method involves hand weeding and use of rotary weeder.
Using hoe Rotary weeder
・The cultural method involves good land preparation, closer crop spacing,
flooding. Most weed seeds or rhizome can not germinate or grow without air
under the surface of puddled soil.
・Chemical contro linvolves the use of appropriate herbicides.
A herbicide is a chemical used to kill or prevent the growth of weeds.
-3 4-Kind of herbicide
Contact herbicides: kill only the parts that are sprayed.
Normally applied to leaves and stems.
Propanil(selective), Paraquat (non selective )
Systemic herbicides: herbicide move within the plant to kill portions that were
not sprayed.
A p p l i e dt ol e a v e sa n ds t e m so rt ot h es o i l .

-3 6-Caseworm (Paraponynx stagnalis Zelle )
The larva may eat the leaf tissue. The insectattacks from seedling to tillering stage.Larvae make their cases from leaf.The damage is not uniform because the larvae
floating in their cases are carried to one side of
the field by wind or water currents.Draining the field for 4-6 days killlarvae.
Stem borers ( Pyralidae )
The larvae bore through the stem and eat upthe plant tissue resulting in a condition calleddead heart and / or white head.

Note: Usually insect damage does not
necessitate chemical control since it does notreduce yields significantly.
-3 8-Diseases of Rice
Rice Yellow Mottle Virus (RYMV)
RYMV is known only in Africa and one of the most
damaging diseases of rice in Africa. RYMV is now
a severe problem in eastern and northern Uganda.
Symptoms:
・Stunting of rice plants if infected at early stage.
・Reduce tiller number.
・Yellowing and mottling of leaves.
・Infected plants are easily attacked by other
diseases (such as brown spot) .
Transmission of RYMV
RYMV is transmitted by a vector and also mechanically.
Control of RYMV
There are no practical ways (no chemicals) of curing a plant after it becomes
infected.
Planting resistant varieties is the cheapest and most effective way of controlling
RYMV. Tolerant varieties: NERICA 4, 6, NARIC 1, 2
Eliminating sources of virus:
Rogue(remove)infected rice plants from the rice field. Roguing is successful
when only a low percentage of plants are infected.
Prevent ratoon growth, which is a main source of RYMV.
Direct seeding (Not transplanting) can reduce the occurrence of RYMV.
-3 9-Rice Blast (Magnaporthe grisea )(Pyricularia oryzae )
It is one of the most destructive diseases of rice.
Symptoms:
The fungus produces spots or lesions on leaves, nodes, and panicles and grains.
The spots are elongated and pointed at each end.
Damage of blast:
In severe infections, yields may be reduced by 50 %.
Upland rice is more severely damaged than lowland rice.
Control:
Planting resistant varieties is the most economical way of controlling this
disease.Avoid excess nitrogen fertilizer.
There are several fungicides that effectively control blast but for economic
reason, these are not used in the tropics.
leaf blast neck blast
Sheath Blight (Thanatephorus cucumeris )
Sheath blight causes spots on the leaf sheath.
High temperature and humidity increase theseverity.
Disease cycle:
Sclerotia develop on lesions and drop to the soil
→The fungus survives in sclerotia in the soil
→The sclerotia float on the water surface
during land preparation →The sclerotia
germinate and fungus penetrates the plant →
The fungus grows on the plant.
-4 0-Damage of sheath blight:
Many of the leaves are killed during severeinfections and yields may be reduced by
20-25 %.
Control:
No variety has a high level of resistance to
the disease. Do not apply too much
nitrogen.
There are effective fungicides controlling
the disease, but are economically not recommendable.
Brown spot (Cochliobolus miyabeanus )
The disease is common in soils that arepoorly drained or deficient in nutrients.
Symptoms:
The symptoms are brown spots on theleaf and grain.
Disease cycle:
The disease is transmitted by the infected
seeds.
Damage of brown spot:It lower grain quality and weight.
Control:
The most effective way of controlling
brown spot is to grow plants in good soil
and provide adequate fertilizer.Planting a resistant variety is the most
practical way of controlling.
Treating the seeds with fungicide or hotwater help control the disease.
Seedling stage
-4 1-Leaf scald (Metasphaeria albescens )
Symptoms:
The symptoms are lesion s starting from leaf
tip.
Disease cycle:
The fungus survive on the rice straw.
The fungus penetrate lower leaves.Flooding of rice induce sever occurrence
of this disease.
Damage of leaf scald:It lower the filled grain ratio and grain
quality.
Control:Avoid excess nitrogen fertilizer.
Sheath rot (Acrocylindrium Oryzae )
Symptoms:
Spots develop on the uppermost leaf
sheaths enclosing panicles.The young panicles remain in the leaf
sheath or emerge partially.
Grains remain unfilled or are discoloured.
Disease cycle:
The disease is usually found in plants
i n j u r e db yi n s e c to rd i s e a s e s ,
particularly stem borer and virus
(RYMV).
Hot humid weather favors sheath rot
development.
Damage of sheath rot:Little is known about crop losses caused by sheath rot.
Control:
Little is known about control of this disease.
-4 2-Grain rot (Burkholderia glumae )
Symptoms:
Usually, after heading, spikelets loosegreen colour and become whitish then
finally turn to brown.
Disease cycle:
Seed transmitted disease.
Hot humid weather favours grain rotdevelopment.
This disease is also transmitted by
wind and rain from infected paniclesto near by panicles.
Damage of grain rot:
It lower grain quality and weight.Control:
There is no resistant variety for this disease.
There are several fungicides which effectivelycontrol grain rot but for economic reason, these
are not used in the tropics.
False smut (Claviceps virens )
The occurrence of the di sease is believed to
indicate a good yield because weather
favourable to the development of false smutalso favours good crop production.
Symptoms:
The fungus changes single grain of thepanicle into velvety balls, which may grow
to a diameter of 1 cm.
Usually, only a few grains on the panicle areinfected and the rest remain normal.
Damage of false smut:
Usually, damage of this disease is minimal.Control:
Usually, no control mea sures are necessary.
