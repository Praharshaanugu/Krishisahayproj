FOREWORD  
        Wheat  stands  equally  with  Maize  ensuring  global  food  security .  India  achieved  the  feat of  
"deficit  to  surplus"  status  with  the  introduction of Mexican  dwarf  wheat  that  brought  the  great  
Green  revolution  in India  during  the sixties.  One third of the Indian population depends on wheat  as  
their main food. India  is  the second  largest  producer  of  wheat  after China claiming the position of a  
significant stakeholder in Global wheat production. During the XI plan period (2007-08 to 2011-12), the 
country experienced steep increase in total foodgrains  production. Being one of the major contributors of 
country's total foodgrains production, wheat production  was recorded to be  93.5  million tonnes  reaped 
th
from an area of 29.65 million ha with a productivity level of  3119  kg/ha (4 Adv. estimate of GoI, 2012-13). 
The level of production was further augmented  to an all time record figure  of 95.85 million  tonnes during 
rd
the year 2013-14 ( 3 Adv estimate of Govt of India)
The Directorate of Wheat Development, Ghaziabad has pooled information from various sources 
and brought out this publication “ Status Paper on Wheat” covering  various aspects of cropping season, 
zonal classification viz, 6 zones spread over the entire country , levels of crop production,  pests  and 
disease management, varietal development, post harvest  status and export status etc. in respect of 
Wheat. Besides, status of various ongoing schemes and programmes  of the Government for enhancing 
production and productivity of Wheat in the country that have been documented  in  the  publication.  My 
sincere  word of appreciation is therefore  attributed  to  the team of  Govt of India officials comprising Shri 
Sanjay Lohiya, Joint Secretary(Crops), Dr. D.P.Malik, Addl. Commissioner(Crops) and Dr. G. K. 
Choudhury , Director , Directorate of Wheat Development, Ghaziabad and his entire team for their tireless 
efforts  in bringing out this publication.
I acknowledge  the efforts  made in  documentation of  various  aspects of  wheat  cultivation and 
production  in  an well  organized  and systematic manner . I hope  the publication  will  definitely be helpful 
for the State and Central Governments, policy makers, Extension  workers, academicians and 
researchers besides various  stakeholders including  farming community as a whole.

Wheat is the major constituent of the global food security along with maize and is therefore attracts 
the attention of our policy maker , scientists, development worker , grower and marketing agencies in terms 
of production and productivity are concerned. India ranks second in terms of production and is presently 
reaping record production of 95.85 million ton from an area of about 30 million ha. The giant leap of 
production per se had been the consolidated efforts of the farms at the top and the development workers, 
policy makers and scientists.
th
Although, there had been the quantum jump in production during the 11 Five Year Plan, there 
remaining a dearth of availability adequate information in a complied form to refer. Question raised ever 
now and then by individual in every sector about the Status of Wheat variety there suitability to different 
climatic zones the recommended packages and practices, the pest and disease problem and storage and 
marketing  have forced us to comment us a bunch of information.
The problems of Yellow Rust of Wheat have been a great threat to Wheat as it may be adequately 
stated that “More yield more threats of Rust”. Directorate of Wheat Development have been actively 
involved in collaboration with the Directorate of Wheat Research (ICAR), Karnal and States to carry out 
survey and surveillance in various parts of the country including Ladakh region for the past few years. The 
growing awareness among the growers may thus be envisaged as the outcome of such survey and 
surveillance.
Directorate of Wheat Development, Ghaziabad is indebted to Dr. J. S. Sandhu, Agriculture 
Commissioner , Shri Mukesh Khullar , Former Joint Secretary (Crops), Shri Sanjay Lohiya, Present Joint 
Secretary (Crops), for there impressive encouragement in bringing out this Status paper . Sincere gratitude 
is extended to Smt A. Neeraja, Former Director (Crops) for her encouragement in materialising the 
progress of Status paper . 
Last but not the least deep gratitude is extended to Shri Narender Kumar , Jt Director , Dr. P. P. Singh, 
Senior Technical Assistant, Shri Vipin Kumar Singh and Shri Subrata Sarkar , Technical Assistants whose 
sincere efforts have materialised in bringing out this Status paper .Qksu@QSDl Phone/Fax : 0120-271 1380

130Wheat (Triticum  spp.) belongs to the genus Triticum  of the Poaceae (Gramineae) family 
originally from the Levant region of the Near East and Ethiopian Highlands, but now cultivated 
worldwide. The three species of wheat namely , Triticum aestivum (bread wheat), Triticum durum 
(macaroni wheat) and Triticum dicoccum  (Emmer or Khapli wheat ) grown on commercial basis in 
the Indian subcontinent from pre-historic times with share of production in percent  95%, 4% and 
1% respectively , are being cultivated in the country . 
Wheat is a very adaptable crop and is grown under the wide range of soil & climatic 
0 0 0
conditions. The crop is most successfully grown between latitude of 30N & 60N and between 27 
0 
S & 40S.  In India it is grown mostly in the plains where as in the hills it is cultivated in mountainous 
region of North India & Nilgiris and Palani hills in South India. For convenience of testing & finding 
out the correct adaptability  the country is divided into six different wheat growing zones namely 
Northern Hill Zone (NHZ), North Western Plains Zone (NWPZ), North Eastern Plains Zone 
(NEPZ), Central Zone (CZ), Peninsular Zone (PZ), and Southern Hill Zone (SHZ). The zone -wise 
total percentage of Acreages of wheat crop are 2.9%, 40.1%. 33.2%, 18.1%, 5.4% and 0.4% 
respectively .
Wheat is used by human beings in form of flour for making Chapaties, Semolina and 
Pasta products. It is also used for preparation of bread, biscuits, cookies, cracks, noodles, dalia, 
maida, vermicelli, etc. Wheat straw is also used for the animal feed as fodder and for packaging 
materials.  The Wheat contains nearly carbohydrates 70%, protein 12%, fat 1.7%, minerals 2.7%, 
fiber 2% and moisture 12%. 
Wheat is world's leading cereal crop, cultivated near about 216.6 million hectares with a 
production of 674.88 million tonnes of grain with 3115 kg/ha productivity (2012-13). India (29.90 
million ha) ranks first in  area coverage followed by China (24.13 million ha), w hile in production 
China stands first (120.50 million tonnes) and India ranks second (94.8 million tonnes). As regard 
the average yield of wheat in the world per hectare, France (75 qtls/ha) ranks first followed by 
Germany (73 qtls/ha). 
Wheat (Triticum spp.) is the second most important winter cereal in India after rice. The 
share of Wheat in total food grain production is around 36.25% and share in area is about 24.83 % 
of the total area under food grains. The area under wheat during 2013-14 was 31.13 million ha with 
rd
a production of 95.85 million tonnes and productivity of 30.6qtl/ha (3 Advance Estimates 
2013-14, DAC). About 99.5% of the wheat production comes from Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, 
Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar , Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, West Bengal, EXECUTIVE SUMMAR Y
iUttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir and remaining contributed by rest of the 
States.
The total production increased to the magnitude of more than six folds from roughly 12.3 
million metric tons in 1964-65 to an estimated 95.85 million metric tons in 2013-14. This feat was 
achieved as a result of a strong research back up that facilitated the development of improved high 
yielding varieties of wheat resistant to diseases with stable performance. 
All India Coordinated Wheat Improvement Project (AICWIP) working in close collaboration 
with Rockfellar Foundation as was desired by Dr. Norman E. Borlaug. It recognizes and overviews 
inter-disciplinary collaborations between various cooperating centers and helps to promote close 
inter institutional linkages, international and intra-national exchange of materials and is finding 
solution to specific problems. The main strength and approach of AICWIP  is multi-disciplinary and 
multi-locational type of comprehensive research and testing of newly developed genotypes 
besides taking care of germplasms evaluation through various national and international 
nurseries. The real breakthrough in wheat revolution started after introduction of Mexican varieties 
and breeding materials in the country and free flow of material to the wheat coordinating centres. 
Since its inception of (1965) the wheat programme,  both the Central Varietal Release Committee 
(CVRC) and State Varietal Release Committee (SVRC) has released  about 375 Wheat varieties 
so far. Out of these, 316 were bread wheat, 49 durum wheat and 5 dicoccum wheat besides 5 
Triticales were developed. 
 The genetic breakthrough of Indian wheat research  achieved during the pre and post 
green revolution era such as Terminal heat tolerance, Adult Plant Resistance (APR) and Durable 
Rust Resistance (DRR), Karnal Bunt Resistant (KBR),  Genetic adaptation  of wheat to Salt 
tolerance, Genetic bio-fortification, use of Transgenic and Gene Exchange and hybridization etc.
The sole responsibility for production of breeder seeds is coming under the preview of 
Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) & State Agricultural Universities (SAUs). Further , 
the responsibility for production of foundation and certified seeds are by State Seeds 
Corporations/State Department of Agriculture to the extent of 40% of the requirement, National 
level seed agencies have the responsibility of 40% & Private seed sectors have the responsibilities 
of remaining 20% of the requirement. The present average Seed Replacement Rate (SRR) of 
wheat crop is about 32.6 % (2011) against the targeted 33%. This is because of the fact that large 
quantities of farm saved seeds are being used by the wheat farmers across the country . 
Wheat is grown mainly in cropping sequences like Rice-Wheat, Jowar-Wheat, Bajra-
Wheat,  Maize-Wheat, Pulse-Wheat, Cotton-Wheat, Soybean-Wheat etc. in different parts of the 
country under irrigated condition. Under rainfed condition, fallow-Wheat is most common,
iibut sometimes short duration pulse crops may precede Wheat in assured rainfall areas. Some of 
the important problems are:  Depletion of Ground Water Resources, Decline in Soil Fertility ,  
Decline in Factor Productivity , Rising Problem of Insect-pest and Disease Complex and Shift in 
Weed Flora.
North-W estern parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), suggested for infusion of a 
complimentary set of new agricultural technologies to boost productivity growth. These Resource 
Conserving Technologies (RCT s) such as Zero and rotary tillage, Furrow Irrigated Raised Bed 
(FIRB) & Surface Seeding which are sustaining and enhancing the productivity of the rice-wheat 
system at reduced cost of production, are backed-up by the new research findings conducted in 
participation with farmers.   
To facilitate procurement of food grains, Food Corporation of India (FCI) and various State 
Agencies in consultation with the State Govt. establish a large number of purchase centres at 
various mandis and key points. The Govt. policy of procurement of Food grains has the broad 
objectives of ensuring Minimum Support Price (MSP) to the farmers and also ensuring availability 
of food grains to the weaker sections at affordable prices.  About 280.23 lakh tonnes wheat has 
been procured on MSP  Rs. 1400 per quintal by the various procurement agencies of the country 
during the marketing year 2014-15.
With a view to supplement the efforts of the State Departments of  Agriculture in increasing 
the production and productivity ,  the  Ministry of Agriculture,  Govt.  of  India  are implementing  
National  Food Security Mission, Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India (BGREI), National  
Mission on Sustainable  Agriculture (NMSA),  National  Mission on Agriculture Extension and 
Technology (NMAET), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Y ojana (RKVY), New  Crop Insurance Scheme & 
Crop  loan  at  low  interest  rate (4%) to  the  farmers  in  the country .
Besides, Krishi Karman Award has been provided to the  State Governments   by Ministry 
of Agriculture, Government of India for increase the production of wheat and several awards like   
ICAR Norman Borlaug Award, Chaudhary Devi Lal Outstanding All India Coordinated Research 
Project Award, V asantrao Naik Award for Outstanding Research Application in Dry land farming 
systems, Jagjivan Ram Abhinav Kisan Puruskar /Jagjivan Ram Innovative Farmer Award 
(National/Zonal), N.G. Ranga Farmer Award for Diversified Agriculture have also been provided to 
the Scientists/Research scholars  for development of area specific  improved production 
technology on wheat and wheat based cropping system in the country . 
Though, the total production increased to the magnitude of more than six folds from roughly 
12.3 million metric tons in 1964-65 to an estimated 95.85 million metric tons in 2013-14. In future, 
to meet the growing demand of wheat in the country and to explore the possibility of increase the 
production & productivity of wheat the following researchable as well as developmental issues 
may be flagged.

DESCRIPTION1: CR OP DESCRIPTION
1.1  Scientific Name: Triticum spp .
Triticum sphaer ococcum-  Indian wheat
Triticum aesti vum- common Bread W heat
Triticum dur um- Macaroni wheat 
Triticum dicoccum-  Emmer W heat.
1.2  Origin of  the cr op: 
Wheat is cultivated since pre-historic times in the world. From all possible records , it seems that 
its center of origin is South Western Asia. It is believ ed that Aryans brought wheat grains to India and since then 
it is being grown in India. Records from ancient China show that it is raised there since 2700 BC, and it was also 
known to Eg yptians and inhabitants of  Switzerland as early as Stone Ag e. The Centers of  origin of  Triticum 
species are given below.
1.3  Impor tance:  Wheat is the one of the staple foods of north Indian population. Wheat grains are ground in 
to flour (atta) and consumed mostly in the form of chapati  or leavened bread. Soft wheat is used for making 
chapati, bread, cake, biscuits , pastr y and other bakery products whereas hard wheat is used for manufacturing 
rawa, suji, and sewaya. In areas where rice is a staple food grain, wheat is also eaten in the form of puri etc. It is 
also used for making cakes and sweet meats etc. Wheat grain is used for preparing starch. Wheat straw is used as 
fodder , padding material and mulching material.
1.4  Morpholo gy:  Wheat is an annual plant belonging to the family Poaceae (Gramineae).
1.4.1: Roots – Wheat plant consists of two sets of roots viz seminal roots and clonal roots (crown 
roots).  Seminal roots arise from germinating seedlings and the crown roots arise from the basal node of plant. 
The crown roots form the permanent root system while the seminal roots dry after about 30 days of the seedling 
emerg ence. 
1.4.2:  Stem: - Wheat stem (culm) is erect, cylindrical, jointed and smooth. The solid joints are termed as 
nodes which separate the plant into sections known as internodes and these nodes/inter nodes are differentiated 
when plants star t elong ating. The lo wer inter nodes are shor ter while the upper ones are progressively long er. 
The main culm produces branc hes at the base close to the ground called the tillers (primar y) and the tillers 
produce the additional tillers known as secondar y and tertiary tillers .
1.4.3:  Leaves: Wheat leaves consist of two parts, the leaf sheath which encircles the stem and the blade 
that bends away from the stem. The foliag e arrangement on culm is opposite . Table- 1.1:  Centers of origin of T riticum species

11.4.4:  Inflorescence: The inflorescence is called  ear or spike. Three to five  florets are arranged in spikelets 
on rachis node. Each floret contains three anthers (androecium) and one ovary (gynoecium) bearing bifurcated 
feathery stigma. Cleistogamous condition i.e. pollination takes place in closed flower favours self pollination. But out 
crossing to the extent of 5% many take place depending upon the floral morphology of varieties.
1.4.5:  Seed:  Wheat seed is called caryopsis with a thin walled pericar p enclosing single seed coat and 
testa is fused with pericar p. The seed shape is oval and the colour is red, white or amber .
1.5:  India's global position, Crop Species grown and their distribution: Currently , India is second largest 
producer of wheat in the world after China with about 15% share in  total world's wheat production. Currently , 
India is surplus in wheat production and in a position to expor t. Three species of Wheat namely , (i) T. aestivum, 
(ii) T. durum and (iii) T. diococcum  are being cultivated in the countr y, the details are  as under :
Table- 1.2:  Wheat  Species-wise contributions in production in India
1.6:  Nutritional value: 
Wheat is used by human being  in the form of flour for making Chapaties , Semolina and Pasta products . 
It is also used for preparation of bread, biscuits , cookies , cracks, noodles , dalia, maida, vermicelli, etc.  Wheat 
contains about  70% carboh ydrates , 12% protein, 1.7% fat, 2.7% minerals , 2% fiber and 12% moisture .
1.6.1:  Quality Parameter s: 
Significant nos of wheat grain samples are analysed every year under All India Coordinated trials. These nd

HI-1500, HW-2004, DL-788-2, GW-173, GW-273, G-322, Raj-3077, HD-2833The  parameters  considered important for  determining wheat quality are the grain Protein Content, ß - 
Carotene Content, Hectolitre Weight, Sedimentation Value, Moisture content, Gluten(wet,dry and gluten index), 
Grain Hardness index/appearance, Test weight, Alkaline Water Retention Capacity  and  Yellow Berry Incidence.
Hard wheat (T.aestivum) with strong gluten content are the main quality requirements for bread 
making . For biscuit making,  the requirements are Low protein with weak gluten content found in diococcum type 
of wheat or soft what  and for chapatti making, the requirements are medium to high protein and medium gluten 
.Hard type of wheat (T.durum) with strong gluten, high protein with high  ß - Carotene Content are required for 
Pasta and traditional products making .
The Indian   bread wheat or aestivum and pasta or durum wheat varieties possess low levels of 
grain iron (27-55 ppm), and zinc (20-50 ppm). Therefore , there is a requirement of enhancing the iron, zinc and 
micron utrient content in wheat through biofor tification. With an objecti ve of developing biofor tified wheat, 
many cultivars or genotypes have been identified or developed for cultivation through implementation of 
suitable breeding strategies . Some promising  cultivars  recently identified for best quality and nutritional 
parameters are as follows:

Wheat is grown in India on an area of about 31.18 Million ha. with a  production of 95.91 Million 
tonnes and producti vity of  3.1 t/ha (2013-14). Analysis of area, production and producti vity of wheat during 
the last decade (1999-2000 to 2013-14) indicated that the major wheat producing states that achieved the  
average producti vity of 3t/ha and above are Uttar Pradesh (98.56 lakh ha), Punjab (35 lakh ha), Haryana (25.22 
lakh ha), Rajasthan( 30.80 lakh ha). The significantly contributing states are Madh ya Pradesh (57.92 ha), Bihar 
(22.57 lakh ha),  Jharkhand (1.73 lakh ha), Gujarat(13.51 lakh ha),  West Beng al (3.35 lakh ha) and  Uttarakhand 
(3.48 lakh ha) are with the producti vity categ ory range of 2-3 t/ha. Maharashtra (10.97 lakh ha), Jamm u & 
Kashmir (2.93 lakh ha)  and Himac hal Pradesh (3.56 lakh ha)  are largely rainfed wheat  growing states and have 
little more than 1.5 t/ha producti vity.  These States contribute about 99% of total wheat production in the 
countr y.  Remaining  States  namely ,   Karnataka, Assam,  Chhattisg arh,  Delhi  and  other  North  Easter n  
States contribute only about rest 1 % of the total Wheat  production in the countr y and are below 2t/ha 
th
producti vity.  The  record production of 95.91 million tonnes of wheat in the countr y ( 4 Advance Estimate , 
DES, GoI, 2013-14)  against the targeted production of 92.50 million tonnes during 2013-14 from an area of 
31.3 million ha with the average producti vity of 3.05 tonnes/ha  is the significant achievement in wheat 
production in the countr y(Annexur e I).
4COMP ARA TIVE
ANAL YSISA comparison of Area, production and yield indicated that, despite a minor decline in the global  
area under the crop, there  was a significant increase in  production of the crop with an increase in yield 
over the years .  Among the major wheat producing countries , China, India and Australia recorded 
increase in production and producti vity whereas Russian Federation and USA had the declined 
production despite the fact that there was an increase in yield level.
In the  domestic scenario , the states viz. Uttar Pradesh, Madh ya Pradesh, Punjab , Rajasthan, Bihar , 
Haryana, West Beng al, Maharashtra and Gujarat have been the  major wheat growing states in the countr y.  The  2: COMP ARA TIVE ANAL YSIS

     Wheat is grown in India on an area of about 31 Million ha. with a  production of 95.91 Million tonnes 
and producti vity of  3.1 t/ha (2013-14). A comparati ve analysis of area, production and producti vity of wheat 
during the last decade (1999-2000 to 2013-14) indicated that during 2013-14 the major wheat producing States 
achieved the  average producti vity of 3t/ha and above are Uttar Pradesh (98.56 lakh ha) with 9.9% increase over 
1999-2000 , Punjab (35 lakh ha) with 3.23% increase over 1999-2k, Haryana (25.22 lakh ha) with 13.3% increase 
over 1999-2000, Rajasthan( 30.80 lakh ha) with 23.4% increase over 1999-2000. The significant contributing

Himac hal Pradesh (3.56 lakh ha)  are largely rainfed and have more than 1.5 t/ha producti vity.  These States 
contribute about 99% of total wheat production in the countr y.  Remaining  States  namely ,   Karnataka, Assam,  
Chhattisg arh,  Delhi  and  other  Nor th  Easter n  States contribute only ab out rest 1 %  of the total W heat  
production in the countr y and are below 2t/ha producti vity. The record production of 95.91 million tonnes of 
th
wheat in the countr y (4 Advance Estimate , DES, GoI, 2013-14)  against the targeted production of 92.50 
million tonnes during 2013-14 from an area of 31.3 million ha with the average producti vity of 3.05 tonnes/ha  
(Annexur e I).
2.2:  Area, Production and Yield status of major Wheat growing countries:
Wheat is being  cultivated in nearly 216.6 million hectares in the world  with a production of 674.88 
million tonnes of grain and producti vity of 3115 kg/ha (FAOSTAT, 2012-13). Highest  area  coverage  was   in 
India followed by China, Russian Federation, U.S.A., Australia, Kazakhstan, Canada, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran, and 
Ukraine . The major wheat producing countries are China (17.07%), India (14.06%), U.S.A. (9.15%), France 
(5.97%), Russian Federation (5.59%), Australia, Canada, Pakistan, Germany , Turkey and Ukraine . The highest 
producti vity was attained  in France (75 qtls/ha), followed by Germany (73 qtls/ha), U.K. (66 qtls/ha), Egypt 
(65 qtls/ha), China (49 qtls/ha), Poland (41 qtls/ha), Italy (40 qtls/ha), India's (31 qtls/ha), U.S.A (31 qtls/ha)
6 and  Argentina (29 qtls/ha). India's share in world wheat area is about 13.8%, whereas it occupies 14.06% share 
th
in the production but ranks 8 position in producti vity (Annexure II).
2.3: Wheat Yield Gap with other  countries:
Despite India's significant share in global wheat area the total production there is marginal increase in 
producti vity, when compared between India and World  with 31.73 qtls/ha and 31.15 qtls/ha respecti vely. 
Highest producti vity was found in France (75.99 qtls/ha) followed by Germany (73.28 qtls/ha), U.K. (66.57 
qtls/ha), Egypt (65.16 qtls/ha), China (49.95 qtls/ha), Poland (41.2 qtls/ha), Italy (40.16 qtls/ha), whereas 
th
India's (31.73 qtls/ha) rank is 8 in producti vity. With the increased pressure on cultivable land, there is hardly 
any scope for expansion of area under wheat in our countr y. The ma in emphasis w ould b e on increasing the 
producti vity of wheat by adopting the impro ved cultivation practices , impro ved technologies and quality inputs 
for which vast potentialities still have been remaining untapped yet. 
2.4. State-wise yield potential recorded under Frontline Demonstrations (FLD) in All India 
Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) vis-à-vis National/State Average  and yield gap analysis:
An analysis of yield gap (Annexure III(a) to III(l) )  in wheat in major wheat growing  states  viz., Bihar , 
Gujarat, Madh ya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan  and Uttarakhand  for the last ten years ( 2003-
04 to 2012-13) indicated that  despite possibilities of higher yield potentialities , there have been   consistent yield 
gaps in these states  mostly ranging from 1 to 2 t/ha or even more .  The  gap was found to be  wider  in the  states 
of Himac hal Pradesh and Jamm u & Kashmir where the gap was ranging from  the level of 1 t/ha onwards 
which contin ued to be widened and showed  increasing trend over the years . The narrow  yield gap ( < 1 t/ha)  
was recorded  in Punjab and Haryana  and  West Beng al which indicates that there is relati vely little  scope for 
increasing producti vity in these states with the existing technolog y.  
FLDs under AICRP project conducted during 2012-13 in various centers show that there is a huge gap 
between state average yield vis-à-vis national yields . The average yield of FLDs center was both Impro ved 
varieties (39.12 qtls/ha) is higher than the National average (31.13 qtls/ha). Highest results in   FLDs were 
found in Punjab with 53.06 qtls/ha in FLDs conducted centers whereas state average is 49.95 qtls/ha followed 
by Har yana center (51.4 qtls/ha) whereas state average is 48.19 qtls/ha.  It implies that there remains a good 
oppor tunity to increase the production of our countr y by focusing on the Madh ya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, 
Maharashtra and Assam (Annexure III (a) TO III(l)). Comparison of 564 nos of wheat FLDs conducted in 
various states during 2013-14 indicated that although there was  the highest yield about 5 t/ha or more was  
recorded in Haryana (54.63 q/ha) followed by Punjab (52.36 q/ha), Rajasthan(50.59 q/ha) Delhi(50.54 q/ha) 
and Uttar Pradesh (49.73 q/ha) but  maxim um yield gain  with the demonstrated technologies was obser ved in 
Madh ya Pradesh with 43.53 q/ha(41.65%) followed by J&K with (33.18%), Jharkhand (30.64%), Chhattisg arh 
(23.07%), Assam(22.76%), Himachal Pradesh (21.71%), West Bengal(19.42%), Bihar (15.07%), 
Maharashtra(15.05%), Rajasthan(14.93%), Delhi(13.52%), Karnataka (13.18%), Uttar Pradesh (8.87%) and 
Gujarat(6.11%). This indicated that there is a near plateau situation in yield  in the  states of Punjab , Haryana and 
Rajasthan which needs to be finer tuned to break the yield barrier  but ample scope  still remains to attain even 
higher yield gain in states like  Madh ya Pradesh, Bihar , Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. 
2.5. Demand and suppl y scenario of wheat   in India:
Wheat represents one of the most widely grown cereal crop for global food security with an 
average global harvest of about 674.88 million tonnes of grain during 2012-13. India stands second after China 
in terms of production of wheat.  During the past few years particularly during period of the XI Five year plan,  
7India witnessed a steep increase in wheat production and producti vity. Countr y achieved a record production of 
th
95.91 million tonnes with more than  3t/ha producti vity during 2013-14 ( 4  Advance Estimate , DES, GoI), the 
th
beginning of the 12 Five Year Plan. 
The projected demand and supply scenario of wheat(D AC,MOA,GoI,2013) indicated that the 
projected demand of wheat during 2016-17 will be 89 million tones which is expected to be increased to a level 
of 98 million tones during 2020-21 as against an  anticipated actual production or projected supply of  93-104 
million tones thereb y indicating a huge mark etable surplus of wheat in the countr y. 
rd
It was revealed during the deliberations in the 53 All India Wheat Workshop (2014)  that annual  
producti vity growth rate of wheat during post  2000 period  is about 1.6% (whic h is also confir med by a 
publication on medium term outlook by NCAER ,2013); the existing or projected population growth during the 
period 2010-2050 would be 0.8. Besides , there is a decline in the status of stagnation in wheat producti vity 
obser ved  after 1998-99.  As such, with this annual output growth   of 1.6% till 2050, the per capita availability 
shall be  just 34%  which  is envisag ed to be  the requirement to maintain the sustainability of wheat production. 
The present challeng e is therefore to sustain this 1.6% g rowth till 2050. T he comparati ve analysis of demand 
and supply scenario  involving  both historical and projections towards 2050 indicated that India may achieve 
the targeted  140 million tonnes of wheat by 2050  for which there is the requirement of maintaining at least 1% 
rd
annual growth rate in wheat producti vity over 2012-13 and 2013-14 (53 All India Wheat Workshop , 2014).
2.6:  Expor t-impor t status of Wheat   :
       Expor t of Indian wheat is increasing   from the ye ar 2001- 02 onw ards. The maxim um ex port of 
wheat from India was in the year 2003-04   with 40.93 lakh tones of value  of Rs. 1459.82 crores .  The expor t was 
thereafter was in a declining trend till 2010-11. However bumper wheat production in the countr y during 2011-
12 witnessed an increasing trend of Indian wheat expor t (7.41 lakh tones worth Rs.1023.27 crores). The expor t 
of Indian wheat was obser ved  to be at an all time record of 66.64 lakh tones  during 2012-13 that was worth 
Rs.14,416.9 crores (Annexure IV ).India expor ted 55,62,374.75 MT of wheat to various countries (viz. 
Bangladesh, Korea, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates , Yemen and Oman) worth Rs. 9261.60 crores during the 
year 2013-14 (Ref. APED A, 2014).
The major impor ters of Indian wheat are Bangladesh, United Arab Emirates , Philippines , Yemen, 
Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Iraq, Singapore , Bahrain, Sri Lanka, etc. India is also expor ting quality Durum 
Wheat to countries like Philippines , Bangladesh, Oman, Singapore , Sudan, etc., whereas Wheat seed is being 
expor ted to Oman, Vietnam, Malaysia, etc.
Looking to the stoc k of wheat a vailable with the countr y, there is v ast potential for expor t of wheat to 
other countries for human consumption and also for industrial purposes . 
Durum potential for expor t: Out of 3 species of Triticum, durum is having more potential in terms of 
expor ts to other countries . Some of the factors making durum for making expor t  are its increasing 
global demand, value addition potential, better price in mark et and resistance to Karnal bunt.  
The dry and hot environment of Madh ya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Souther n 
Rajasthan are most suited for durum cultivation. These areas offer quality production of durum but at 
the same time production is less and hence difficult to compete in the expor t mark et.
8Varietal 
Development3: VARIET AL DEVELOPMENT
Since  inception  of the wheat programme (1965), both the Central Varietal Release Committee (CVR C) 
and State Varietal Release Committee (SVR C) has released  about 375 wheat varieties so far.  Out of these ,  316 
were bread wheat, 49 dur um wheat and 5 dicoccum wheat besides 5 T riticales w ere dev eloped. T he All India 
Coordinated Wheat and Barley Impro vement  Project  conducts  a   number  of well-org anized  multi-location  
yield  trials  for  different p roduction  conditions . The testing  has contributed in release of  wheat  varieties

9CLIMATIC 
REQUIREM ENT4: CLIMATIC REQUIREMENT
Wheat is mainly grown during Rabi season  and has wide adaptability . It can be grown not only in the 
tropical and sub-tropical zones , but also in the temperate zone and the cold tracts of the far north, beyond even 
othe 60 North altitude . Wheat can tolerate severe cold and snow and resume growth with the setting in  warm 
weather in spring . It can be cultivated from sea level to an altitude of  3300 meters .
The most  favourable climatic condition for wheat cultivation is  cool and moist weather during the 
vegetative growth period followed by dr y, war m weather for the g rain to ma ture and ripening . The optimum 
0
temperature range for ideal germination of wheat seed is 20-25 C .Warm and damp climatic conditions are not 
suited for wheat growing.
During the heading and flowering stages, excessively high or low temperatures and drought are harmful 
to wheat. Cloudy weather , with high humidity and low temperatures is conduci ve for rust attack. Wheat plant 
0
requires about 25-30 C optim um average temperature at the time of ripening . The temperature  at the time of 
0
grain filling and development are very crucial for yield. Temperatures a bove 25 C during this period tend to 
depress grain weight. The cong enial temperature for various growth stages of wheat crop is as under :
Growth sta ges      Temperatur e requir ements 
Germination            20 to 25°C mean daily
Accelerated g rowth            20 to 23°C mean daily
Proper grain filling             23 to 25°C mean daily
4.1: Ef fect of  temperatur e on W heat Yield:
Temperature requirement may slightly differ from one variety to another at the time of 
0
germination. The critical minim um  temperature  for wheat  crop is  from 3.5 to 5.5 C,  optim um 20-
0 0 0
25 Cand the maxim um  is around 35 C. If temperature is more than 30 C at the time of maturity , it 
leads to forced maturity and yield loss.  An UN report (Anon, 2011) stated that the earth will be warmer 
0
by 2.4C by the year 2020 and the crop yield in India may fall by upto 30% by then. 
Instances in India are there indicating that the terminal heat creates a significant yield reduction 
in wheat. Therefore , maintaining the optim um sowing time and growing ideal cultivars may manag e the 
problem to some extent. Conventional breeding processes generally aimed at diseases resistance , quality 
impro vement and ultimately yield enhancement. In view of the climate chang e impact particularly that of 
temperature rise, these breeding programmes  need to be focused to develop heat tolerant varieties . Low 
temperature during the initial stage and high temperature at later maturity stage lead to the completion of major 
part of wheat growth cycle .Table- 4.1: T emperature requirements at different Growth stages
10In the North western India, it has been obser ved that considering every gain weighs 40 mg,  every degree C rise 
0
in mean temperature during the terminal reproducti ve phase beyond 17C  causes a loss of yield to the tune of  
*
2.5q/ha .  This is due to the fact that the crucial advanced reproducti ve phase is affected by rising temperature 
results in poor grain filling, shorter earhead,  lesser 1000 grain weight and ultimately lower production.
4.2:  Recommendation for cultivation of Wheat in view of climatic change:
Due to climate chang e, there is an overall reduction in crop yield and the various crop production stages 
right from sowing to harvesting and threshing are badly affected. It ultimately  causes decline in water resources 
and  soil organic matter . Some preventive measures given as below for minimize the loss by climatic chang e.
Modification in Agronomy of crop- Manipulation of sowing dates/optimisation to 
minimise the effect of temperature/soil moisture on germination, panicle initiation, 
panicle sterility etc.
Diversification of farming- shifting from sole cropping of wheat to diversified system i.e.
 sowing of wheat mixed with gram, mustard, pea etc. or intercropping with mustard, gram etc.
Use of zero seed-cum-fertilizer drill – this is energy –cum-resource conservation 
technolog y.
Inclusion of green manures crop in the cropping system to build up the nutrient status of the soil 
resulting its soil health sustainability .
Inclusion of high yielding rainfed/heat tolerant  wheat varieties in the cropping system to tackle  
the related problem.
Use of mechanization in farming- This will help in timely execution of agricultural 
operations  and will save from the vagaries of climate .
Use of light irrigations  in the event of terminal temperature rise.
Judicious use of water, adoption of  Integ rated Nutrient Manag ement (INM), Integ rated Pest 
Manag ement (IPM) and Conser vation Agriculture practices .
Use of System of Wheat Intensification (SWI) technique  has been emerging as a 
technique to ensure quick germination as well as  in economizing the use of water. The 
technique  needs to be authenticated by researc h findings yet.
Use of  hydrogel-  an indig eneous semisynthetic superabsorbent polymer developed by 
Indian Agricultural researc h Institute , New Delhi  recommended for reducing moisture 
stress  resulting in  reduced irrigation and fertigation requirement of crops .

11GENETIC 
POTENTIALITY 
ADVANCEMENT5: GENETIC PO TENTIALITY AD VANCEMENT
5.1: Genetic br eakthr ough f or yield impr ovement:
All India Coordinated Wheat Impro vement Project (AICWIP) is the nodal agency for applied  wheat 
researc h in India. The advent of dwarf wheat and initiation of AICWIP took place simultaneously in India 
during 1965.  It provided a strong platfor m for working in close collaboration with Rockfellar Foundation as 
was desired b y Dr. Nor man E. Borlaug . It recognizes and overviews interdisciplinar y collaborations betw een 
various cooperating centers and helps to promote close inter institutional linkag es, international and intra-
national exchang e of materials and is finding solution to specific problems . The main strength and approac h of 
AICWIP is multidisciplinar y and multilocational  type of comprehensi ve researc h and testing of newly 
developed genotypes  besides taking care of germplasm evaluation through various national and international 
nurseries .  The real breakthrough in wheat revolution started after introduction of Mexican varieties and 
breeding materials in the countr y and free flow of material to the wheat coordinating centers .
The AICWIP through their 31 centres located across the countr y using multidisciplinar y and 
multilocational approac h as modus operandi was able to evolve number of wheat  varieties that are disease and 
pest resistance , fertilizer responsi ve and high yielding growing under different production conditions . 
Promising genotypes have been evolved by the collaborati ve effor ts  are for making chapattis , Bread, Biscuit and 
Pasta product s . The genetic breakthrough of Indian wheat r esearc h  achieved dur ing the pre and post g reen 
revolution era are as follows:
5.1.1. Basic Research: . 
Maintenance of genetic variability in India  was sustained  during the process of development 
of elite lines  of wheat so as to minimize the risk caused by narrow genetic base. During pre Green Revolution 
era, broadly selection process was in practice; but during 1905 in  Pusa (Bihar) and in 1907 at Loyallpur ( in now 
Pakistan) breeding programme was initiated. Prog ramme of rust resistance was initiated later in Shimla. 
Development of newer wheat varieties till 1965 was mainly through (i) introduction, (ii)selection and  (iii) 
hybridization among local races . However, during the post Green Revolution era,  Dr. NE Borlaug brought 
specific lines of wheat from CIMMYT , Mexico and evaluated them through the specific breeding programme in 
India. Resultantly , varieties viz., Lerma Rojo 64A, Sonora 64 and PV18 were evaluated through SAUs and ICAR 
System as highly photo-insensiti ve, short duration, input responsi ve and high yielder and released in India. 
Consequently , the wheat production in India was increased from 11.4 million tonnes (1966-67) to 29 million 
tonnes (1976-77) period referred to as Green Revolution era. 
The Mexican dwarf wheat varieties exhibit shor ter coleoptiles g rowth as compared to that of  Indian 
tall ones which led the Indian scientists to maintain the shallo w depth of sowing and the optim um depth 
was recommended to be 5-7 cm. With the active cooperation of various centres under 
12AICWIP , varieties of breadwheat, durum wheat and dicoccum wheat have been developed through their 
mulilocation an d multidisciplinar y trials across the countr y.   Again, through the process of  characterization 
and evaluation of germplasms , more than 13000 accessions h ave been evaluated so far in collaboration with 
National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR),  Directorate of Wheat Researc h (DWR) and other 
cooperating centres and ultimately many promising germplasms have been identified and  for varietal 
development  for specific traits which are as follows:

High Protein IC 45437, HS 431, IC 57579 etc.
5.1.2. Significant Genetic Br eakthr ough  f or Yield Impr ovement of  Wheat:
Terminal Heat Tolerance is one of the impor tant traits for  grain filling which ultimately 
deter mines the yield impro vement factor . In all wheat growing situations , particularly under  late sown 
situations of easter n India, the terminal heat stress makes a bar rier towards achieving desired yield of wheat. 
After development of C 306 variety during the sixties but with a  slow deceleration in yield of the variety , there 
was a quest for newer varieties tolerant to terminal heat stress .  Development of newer varieties like PBW 343 
and Raj 3765  during mid nineties has paved the way towards achieving higher yield of wheat. Use of molecular 
mark ers for heat tolerance has been a genetic tool for development of heat tolerant varieties . 
Adult Plant Resistance (APR) and Durable Rust Resistance (DRR) are the main 
concer n in Indian wheat cultivation  in respect of  achieving higher yield.  Indian wheat prog ramme 
contributed through introg ressing the APR gene Lr34  in conjug ation with other resistant genes  which 
have contributed to the durability of Leaf and Stripe rust to a number of Indian wheat varieties viz., 
HD2189. Bread wheat cultivars viz., GW 322 and NIAW 34 showed APR to most virulent5.1.  Identified Ger mplasms Line f or various T olerances
13 and predominant pathotypes of leaf rust. Indian breeding program have been able to develop wheat varieties 
viz., HD 2937, HPW 251, HS 461, HUW 598, PBW 561, PBW 574, PBW 575, PBW 579, PDW 300, VL 882, VL 
892 and WH 1021 that showed APR to both leaf and stripe rusts of wheat. Durable resistance to stem rust of 
bread wheat variety HD 2009 has been attributed to Sr2 and Sr30 and several other minor APR genes. The 
overall resistance  gene Sr31 has been the major one protecting the Indian bread wheat varieties including the 
durum varieties  like HD 4672 and HI 8498 from the dreaded Stem Rust including Ug99 .  However, as a future 
protection for any possible threat from stem rust including Ug99 , Indian breeding programme envisag es 
rebuilding the gene complex like Sr2 complex for varietal development.  With these there was a stability in wheat 
yield looking ahead for further enhancement.
Karnal Bunt (K B)  is another serious problem in achi eving higher wh eat yield. Qu arantines 
imposed by several countries have jeopardized  free trade of wheat from the countries where KB is prevalent. 
Indian breeding programme could achieve the significant success in containing the disease ( seed/soil borne) 
after development of the most versatile variety PBW 343 during 1995. The disease is most prevalent in the 
NWPZ and resistance breeding is the answer to the disease. Higher degree of KB resistance by accumulating 
diverse genes (additive gene action) was obtained  to  develop resistant varieties. Some of these varieties  were 
PBW 502 and  Raj 1482 besides PBW 343,PBW34, PDW233 etc.. 
   Genetic adaptation of wheat to Salt tolerance attracts attention to wheat grower s for yield 
improvement. Genetic and physiological parameters  of selection were worked more precisely and intensively 
by Central Soil Salinity Research Institute (CSSRI), Karnal  which led to the development and release of  a salt 
tolerant variety KRL 1- 4 during 1990 followed by KRL 19, KRL 210 and KRL 213 in the following years 
which registered higher yields in saline/sodic areas.  
Wheat is being made nutritionally rich through  Genetic Biofortification making higher 
nutrients contents in g rains viz, Iron, Zinc an d Boron .  quality wheat breeding pr ogramme initiated during 
post 1999-2000 era has helped in developing good quality wheat for different end products like chapatti, bread 
etc. such product specific varietal development is considered to be a genetic breakthrough in Indian wheat 
breeding programme.  Collaborative breeding programme  focused on transferring genes governing Zn and 
Fe from spe cific lines to hig h yielding eli te ones and varieties like PBW 343 was developed. The res earch on 
x Genotype x Environment (G  E) interaction programme is ongoing to develop newer nutritionally rich 
cultivars.   
5.1.3.Recent Genetic breakthrough in improving Wheat yield and quality 
Recently ,  promising varieties were evaluated by DWR,  Karnal (ICAR)  under National Initial 
Varietal T rials (NIVT s), Initial Varietal T rials (IVT s)  and special trials . Among 311 entries evaluated 
under NIVT s  and 36 entries evaluated in IVTs, as many as 80 (45 bread wheat and 35 durum wheat) of 
these were found high yielding and disease resistant.  The promising  entries are as under :

165.2:  Use of  Adv ance tools f or Genetic impr ovement:
5.2.1.  New Plant T ype (NPT) Appr oach: 
Effor ts made to genetically architecture a new plant type to have higher Harvest Index and biomass and 
ultimately higher yield which was carried out through introg ressing the desired traits . Varieties like Vaishali and 
Vidisha are the examples of such NPT approac h. Many other genotypes were developed that have higher test 
weight, higher grains per spike, good root system, higher biomass etc. were developed through this NPT 
approac h.  
 5.2.3.  Use of Transgenics and gene exchange for wheat impr ovement: 
Introductions from different countries have made significant achievements in Indian wheat 
impro vement programme through recombination breeding . These introductions were used directly  for 
various traits such as sources of disease resistance , drought and heat tolerance , salinity tolerance , early maturing, 
long spikes more than 15 cm,  higher yield etc. A few of these introductions are EC 477993 (WESLEY)  from 
USA  was for stem rust resistance , high quality and higher yield potential. Accessions viz., EC 514345-79 
for high protein and -carotene in Durum wheat and EC 514380 514404 for drought and5.1.4:   Hybridisation in volving wild species and Yield Impr ovement in wheat: . 
Importance of wide crosses were actually initiated in early 1940s. Some particular inter-specific crosses 
involving wild species  led to the development of specific genetic stocks. A typical example is the development of 
the variety C286 is the result of an interspecific cross Type1/Khapli/C250.  Niphad4 in western India was 
derived from the cross Motia(durum)/Khapli/NP4 (aestivum). MACS9 was derived from T. polonivum /T. 
durum crosses. Some important genetic stocks developed through interspecific crosses involving wild species are 
as follows:

5.3. Hybrid W heat: 
Hybrid wheat is an area wherein technologies tend to be used as an advanced tool to achieve a 
genetic breakthrough in breaking the yield barriers in wheat. The activities of researc h on evolution of 
hybridization in wheat though initiated earlier in the countr y, however, the success is yet to be recorded. These 
researc h activities included primarily on use of Cytoplasmic Genetic Male Sterility (CGMS) approac h and 
Chemical Hybridisation Agents (CHA). Use of CHA approac h was obser ved to be  there with some inherent 
problems and therefore , found not practically feasible and uneconomical. On the other hand, the CGMS 
approac h was the primar y focus of such hybridization programme but the Cytoplasmic genetic male sterility 
and fertility restoration – the two most impor tant components in developing hybrids in the CGMS approac h  is 
yet to achieve a success .

SCEN ARIO6: SEED SCEN ARIO
6.1:  State-wise share of Govt and private sector seed agencies in  seed production/suppl y: 
The Planning Commission once indicated with regard to seeds- “Despite a huge institutional framew ork for 
seed production both in the public and private sector, availability of good quality seeds continues to be a problem for the farmers. As a 
result, they prefer to rely on farm saved seeds; seed replacement rate continues to remain in the range of 2-10 per cent in certain states 
for certain crops, which is much below the desired level of 20 per cent for most crops. As is well known, seed replacement rate has a 
strong positive correlation with the producti vity and production of crops. There is a need to rejuvenate the seeds sector through 
revamping the public sector seed companies , including the State Seed Corporations”.
The National Seed Policy of Govt of India entrusts major responsibility for production of foundation 
and certified seeds is assumed by State seeds corporations/State department of Agriculture to the extent of 
40% of the requirement. National level seed agencies have the responsibility of 40%. Private seed sectors have 
the responsibilities of remaining 20% of the requirement. 
6.2:  State-wise Seed Replacement Rate (SRR) of Wheat :
Seed R eplacement Rate (SRR) is the percentage of  area sown out of total area of  crop planted in the 
season by using certified/quality seeds other than the farm saved seed. There is a strong co-relation between  the 
seed replacement rate and the yields .  
Analysis of  SRR in wheat  in the countr y from 2001 onwards  indicates that the  present average Seed 
Replacement Rate of wheat crop is about 32% (2011)( Annexur e-VI ). The SRR in all the Wheat growing states 
shows an increasing trend. T he stee p increase of  30% or more w as noticeable from 2010 onw ards in  all the 
wheat growing states which may well be correlated as one of the main reasons for record wheat productions of  
more than 90 million tonnes  from 2010 onwards. The SRR varies  from state to state  depending upon the 
availability . Highest SRR (2011) is about  45.9% in the state of Maharashtra.  During 2012, highest SRR 
(41.00%) as against 33.72% during 2010-11 was noticeable in case of Uttar Pradesh (Ref. Wheat varietal profile 
of India, 2013) . The states like Jamm u & Kashmir , Gujarat and Madh ya Pradesh are lagging behind in achieving 
the higher SRR. Inclination of farmers towards the older varieties led to the low mark et demand of seeds of a 
recommended specified variety which ultimately resulted in low breeders seed indent by the states which is 
reflected in the reduced SRR. The breeders seed indent and production of most popular wheat varieties during 
2013-14  is  presented in the later part of this section. A large quantity of farm saved seeds are also  being used 
by the wheat farmers across these states that prevented the newer varieties to imbibe into the system.  Besides , 
massi ve awareness programme for  seed and varietal replacement to shun away from cultivating age old 
varieties ,  induce a break in the disease and pest dynamics and boosting the per ha yield of the crop, the states are 
required to adopt suitable planning for production of breeder's , foundation and certified seeds of desired 
varieties to meet the demand. Breeders seed indent of a particular variety will thus materialize the purpose in the 
states .   
196.3:  State-wise Critical gap in requir ement and share of seed production by  Govt and private sector 
seed agencies :
   6.3.1:  Seed Requir ement of Wheat during XII Five Year Plan (2012-13 to 2016-17)
The responsibility for the production of breeder seed in the countr y lies with the  National Agricultural 
Researc h System (NARS) of the countr y. All the States in the countr y have Agricultural Universities , State 
Farms and other assets , which need to be utilized for production of quality seeds (foundation and certified 
seeds).  Considering the total wheat area of 31 million ha (2013-14) in the countr y distributed over the major 
wheat growing states viz., Bihar , Chhattisg arh, Haryana, Himac hal Pradesh, Jamm u & Kashmir , Jharkhand, 
Madh ya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab , Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand & West Beng al including some 
minor states , the total  certified seed requirement  of  different recommended wheat varieties ( with 33% SRR) 
was worked out to be around 103.17 lakh quintals against which the calculated availability would be  around  90 
lakh quintles . As such there is a projection of  deficit of around 13 lakh quintals of certified seeds (Ref. Wheat 
Varietal Profile of India, 2013) at national level. The detailed  requirement of certified seeds vis-à-vis availability 
are  placed at Annexur e-VII.
6.3.2:  State-wise (Major wheat g rowing states) total seed  requir ement vis-à-vis a gency wise 
allocation for targets of seed production:
The countr y reaped a record wheat harvest of 95.91 million tonnes from an area of more than 31 
million hectares . With the average Seed replacement rate of around 22% for the past decade , the requirement of 
certified seeds is broadly around 31 million tonnes . Since farmers used to sow their farm saved seeds to a large 
extent, the SRR is not being hiked due to the availability of such farm saved seeds thus indulging to the practice 
of maintenance breeding of varieties their own choice .  Such a practice induces  genetic segregation coupled 
with admixture of looking identical phenotypes resulting in either not being able to reap the near potential yield, 
build up of disease and weeds  or stagnant yield of cultivar. Requirement of  quality seed material is therefore of 
utmost impor tance . With a target of enhancing yield level of wheat  under the targeted average SRR of 33% the 
requirement of seeds and  production targets of wheat seeds for various seed agencies as per the guidelines and 
norms of National Seed Policy of Govt of India, the state-wise  requirement  are calculated and placed at 
Annexure-VIII.
6.3.3:  State-wise (Major wheat growing states) & Variety-wise area coverage  & total seed 
requir ement :
The State-wise and Variety-wise requirement of Certified seeds of wheat in various states were worked 
out (Annexure IX). Altog ether 19 varieties are in high demand with 33% SRR and about 16 varieties revealed 
high demand with 25% SRR in the states . Out of more than 300 varieties released so far by the Central Varietal 
Release Committee (CVR C) as well as State Varietal Release Committee (SVR C) so far,  about 50% are there in 
the acti ve chain of  seed production in the far mers fie lds. Despite the fact that some varieties were de veloped
20and released decades back and due to their stress tolerant characteristics , the versatile nature of specific 
cultivars, the varieties still remained in the choice list of farmers even if such varieties have become disease 
prone or comparati vely poor yield.  Such varieties are Lok-1 (1981),  PBW -343 (1995), UP-262 (1977), WH-147 
(1978) etc. Seed production and availability in India are a complex system in India comprising both formal ( by 
Govt regulated system of seed production and distribution) and infor mal components ( use of farm saved 
seeds procured by farmers and spreading farmer to farmer or even state to state).  Variety-wise spread of wheat 
crop   in various major wheat growing states  indicated that although farmers are in the process of adopting 
newer varieties with identical or little higher economic yields , still older varieties with withdra wn  or no 
recommendation are still remaining under cultivation in the farmers fields .  
6.3.4:  Variety-wise  Total  seed  requir ement, availability  &  gap (Recommended vs Non-
recommended/slated for replacement): 
As indicated earlier there are more than 350 varieties of wheat released for cultivation in various wheat 
growing zones in the countr y in about 312 lakh ha of area of which about 50% of these varieties are in the 
active chain of seed production.  A large area around 5-7 million ha of wheat area are still under coverage of 
older or  non-recommended varieties . These varieties are still persistent due to one or another factor like stress 
resistance/tolerance , heat tolerance , good quality , disease resistance and/or absence of other suitable 
alternatives in respect of their versatile nature . 
6.4:  Production of breeder s' seeds :
The indent for production of breeder s seeds  of desired varieties decides the production of 
foundation seeds and ultimately ensures the availability of certified seeds . The Central agencies get a share of these 
breeders seeds aiming at fulfilling the demand of foundation seeds as well as certified seeds of varieties . The target 
of production of exact quantity of breeders seeds during 2013-14 was 21111.07 qtls for 156 varieties . The highest 
indented target was 1313.88 qtls of HD 2967. Other indented varieties for NWPZ  besides HD2967 were DBW17, 
PBW550, HD3043, Raj4037, DPW 621-50 and HD 2851. The varieties viz., K0307,Raj 4120 and HD2733 were the 
highest indented in the NEPZ  during the year. In the Central Zone (CZ) , GW322 was highest indented followed 
by GW366, GW273, HD2932, MP4010 and HD2864. Thhe wheat variety Raj 4037 was highest indented in the 
Peninsular Zone . Varieties viz., HPW236, HPW349, HPW155 were the highest indented in the NHZ . The 
breeder seed indent and production of most popular top ten wheat varietie during 2013-14w ere as follows:
21Barring HD3043 (2012) among  the total 22 varieties indented during 2013-14, the breeders seeds 
production of all other varieties were surplused.  The varieties which were with highest indent for breeders 
seeds production , were  more than 10 years old except HD3043 (2012), HD2967(2010) and DPW621-50 
(2011) all recommended for the NWPZ.  Eleven(11) more  varieties were also indented  during 2013-14 which 
were Raj4120(2008), K0307(2006), PBW343(1994), HD2733(2001) for the NEPZ  and varieties 
HD2932(2008)& HD2189(1979) were  the indented for Peninsular Zone during the year.  Breeders seed indent 
for the varieties viz., HPW236 (2009),  HPW155 (2003), HPW249 (2010), HPW349 ( 2013) and HS507 (2010). 
Thus except the varieties viz., HD2967 (2010) and DPW621-50(2011) for NWPZ and HPW349 (2013) & HPW249 
(2010) both for NHZ,  all other varieties indented for breeders seeds production during 2013-14 were old (more 
22than 10 years) hence defeating the objecti ve of varietal diversification as adopted during the All India workshop 
held in Kanpur two years back.
As against the targeted quantity of 19880.47 qtls, a total quantity of 22492.21 qtls of breeders seed was 
produced during 2013-14, thus a surplus of 1381.14 qtls of indented quantities of breeders seed production 
was recorded.
Deficient production of breeder s seeds was recorded in forty seven (47) wheat varieties during 
2013-14. Such varieties were HD3043(2012), HD2864(2005),C306(1965), MP1203(2009), HD2987(2011), 
PBW590(2008), MP3173(), HD2932(2008), HD2189(1979), MPO1215(2010), MP1202(2010), MP1142(), 
HI1563(1999) and HD2985(). The major deficit production of breeders seeds were obser ved during 2013-14 
for 6 major varieties indented , only three varieties viz., HD3043(2012), HD2987(2011) and HD2985(2011) 
were the recent ones and rest were  old( mo re than 10 Years). T he deficient Breeders seed production ( as in 
2013-14) of 9 most recent wheat varieties were as follows:
While looking at the status of the most recently released wheat varieties , it was obser ved that some 
varieties remained in the state of without any production of breeders seeds during 2013-14 despite availability 
of an indent. These varieties were as under :

The non recommended wheat varieties or  specific varieties being either old ones or their susce ptibility 
to biotic/abiotic stresses as well as stagnating or  declining yield level are still being grown in some zones or 
states . The cultivation of  older varieties prone to incidence of disease and pests results in yield loss. These 
varieties need to be phased out from the existing seed production chain to promote recent varieties under 
different production conditions . The details of varieties not recommended  for  cultivation are presented in 
Annexure-X  The varieties viz., HI 1563  recommended for Central zone (Madh ya Pradesh, Gujarat and parts 
of Rajasthan) and WH1080 for NWPZ (Punjab , Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh, parts of Rajasthan &  
Himac hal Pradesh) both released for cultiv ation during 2011.  In spite of   being the most recent ones , these 
varieties were not included in the indent for breeders seeds by the states . The varieties  need to be include in seed 
production chain for wide adoption in the recommended  zones . .
 6.5.  Suggested measur es for addr essing the lower Seed Replacement Rates (SRR) in States :
The Seed Replacement Rates (SRR) is comparati vely higher in states like Punjab , Haryana, Uttar 
Pradesh, West Beng al, Bihar . On the other hand the SRR is lower in states like Himac hal Pradesh, Gujarat and 
Jamm u & Kashmir . In order to enhance the SRR in the states the following measures may be suggested:
 Indent of Breeders Seeds of desired varieties should be adequately placed by the concer ned states; 
older and disease susce ptible varieties should be extracted out from the seed chain and indenting such 
varieties should be stopped. Mult iplication of  Foundation and cer tified seeds of specific varieties in 
respecti ve zones/states should be adequately planned
 Provisions of incenti ves  under specific schemes like National Food Security mission(NFSM) should 
be  encashed  to upkeep the pace of varietal replacement in a focused manner .

7.1:   Climatic requir ement
Wheat is grown in all types of climatic conditions i.e. tropical, sub-tropical and temperate . In India, 
major wheat  is under cultivation in areas in the sub-tropical region. The cool and sunny winter is  very 
conduci ve for growth of wheat crop. The  range of temperature  required for optim um growth and 
development of wheat is as under :
7.2:   Soil requir ement
Wheat can be grown on all kinds of soils, except the highly alkaline soils and water logged conditions . Soils 
with clay loam or loam texture , good structure and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat 
cultivation. Durum wheat is preferably sown on medium to fine textured soils. 
7.3:   Agronomic Practices

The Wheat crop requires a well pulverized but compact seed bed for good unifor m 
germination. One deep ploughing with soil turning plough followed by two harrowing and planking is 
desirable .

Seed treatment & sowing
 To ensure good germination  and establishment of diseased free crop stand  seeds  must be treated with 
fungicide lik e Thirum or Bavistin 50WP @ 2.5 g/kg seed. Where ther e is problem of  loose smut tre at the 
seeds with Carbendazim (Bavistin 50WP) @ 2.5 g/kg seed or Carbo xin (Vita vax 75 WP) @ 1.5g/kg seed to 
facilitate speedy germination in case of late sowings . Seeds may be soaked overnight followed by drying in 
shed before sowing.  The seeds should be placed 5-6 cm deep below the soil where sufficient soil moisture is 
available to enable germination.  Use of biofer tilisers like Trichder ma viridi ( @ 80 gms for every 10 gms of 
seeds) and Azotobacter   & PSB culture (@ 200 gms per 10 kgs of seeds) help for better plant stand at intial 
stage of the crop. 
7.4:   Wheat Varieties 
Central Agriculture Researc h Institutions and State Agriculture Universities has developed many 
varieties of Wheat suitable for different zones , regions , states and production   conditions . The  significant 
recent varieties that were released during the last 10 years include HD3043(2012), HD2967(2010), 
DBW71(2013), HD2987(2011) and DPW621-50(2011) recommended for the NWPZ. For the NEPZ, the 
recent v arieties include Raj 4120(2008), K0307(2006), HD2985(2009), HPW349(2013) etc . The varieties viz., 
MP1202(2010), MP3336(2013), MP3288(2011) were among the recent ones in the central zone. UAS428 (2012) 
and NIAW1415(2011) were among the recently released varieties for the Peninsular Zone . For the Northern 
Hills Zone , HPW249(2010),  HPW(349) were the prominent ones. The details of these new impro ved varieties 
is given in the Annexur e- V.
7.5:  Fertilizer mana gement- recommended doses for different ecolo gies, micr o-nutrients, organic 
manures, application methods
Manures and fertilizers both play impor tant roles in wheat cultivation. Use of  Farm Yard Manure 
(FYM) impro ves the general physical condition and structure of the soil and its capacity to hold water.  About 
10 to 15 tons of FYM or compost should be applied 4 to 6 weeks before sowing and ØTable- 7.3: Zone-wise Recommended Sowing T ime
26worked well into the soil. A crop of wheat yielding 50 quintals of grain per ha. remo ves 100 to 150 kg nitrog en, 
70 to 80 kg phosphor us and 125 to 150 kg potash from the soil. The response of a given   variety of wheat to 
application of fertilizer , however, varies from field to field and from locality to locality which should be 
regulated  in accordance with the soil test value for the respecti ve nutrients .
The recommended  per hectare dose  of  nitrog en  normally rang es from 120-150 kg under ir rigated 
condition and  half the dose under rainfed conditions in NWPZ and NEPZ. In other zones , the dosag e of 
nitrog en ranges from 90-120 kg under irrigated and 60 kg per ha under rainfed conditions . The dosag e of 
phosphorous and potash have been recommended to be  60 kg P2O5 and  40 kg  per ha. The recommended

In light soils, deficiency of micron utrients (like  Zinc,  Mn,  Sulphur)  in wheat fields particularly 
in the Rice-W heat system (R-W System). The general recommendation in the concer ned  
micron utrient deficient soils is as follows:
277.6:  Irrigation  mana gement:   
The total water requirement of  wheat crop is 450-650 mm, which need to be provided over first 100 
days of crop growth unifor mly.  The loss of water through evaporation and transpiration from the wheat field 
i.e. evapotranspiration which directly influences the growth and yield of the crop.  There is the need for 6  
irrigations for wheat in general.  However, in sandy loam soil 6-8 irrigations may be required whereas in heavy 
clay soil 3-4 irrigations are considered to be sufficient.  The optim um time of irrigating wheat crop based on the 
physiological stages is one of the most impor tant recommended methods of scheduling irrigation. Irrigations 
should be done at right time to minimize evaporation losses .  The recommended time of irrigation is as below:Name of   deficient         Recommended

28Irrigating the crop at the critical growth stages (each ranging from 6-8 cm depth) increases the yield of 
wheat significantly . Depending upon the a vailability of  water, irrigation is recommended to be sc heduled for 
specific critical physiological  growth stages of the crop  as follows:
Micr oirrigation :
Sprinkler  and drip irrigation techniques are the micro irrigation technologies that lead to substantial 
savings of water in irrigating wheat.  In areas of water scarcity or very limited water availability for irrigation, 
such micro-ir rigation techniques are useful in impro ving the Water Use Efficiency (WUE) and the cost of 
production as a whole . The practice of sprinkler irrigation are in practice in Haryana in the NWPZ, Gujarat and 
Madh ya Pradesh in Central Zone(CZ) and Maharashtra Peninsular Zone(PZ). Sprinkler and drip irrigation 
systems recorded significant yield for NWPZ (IW/CPE ratio of 1.20)with 5.3 t/ha, for CZ(IW/CPE ratio of 
0.60) with 4.5 t/ha and for PZ ((IW/CPE ratio of 0.80) with 4.5 t/ha.(R ef. DWR,K arnal,2013-14). However, 
the initial high cost of the system and the higher recur ring maintenance cost poses a hindrance particularly for 
the Small & Marginal Farmers (SMF).

        7.7.1. Laser Land Leveller: 
Recommendation is there  for levelling of the land by Laser land leveler  that makes the field 
ideal for unifor m moisture distribution to be available for wheat crop's root zone. It increases the WUE 
by about 35-45% and Increased Nutrient Use efficiency by about 15-25% and with the yield advantag e 
of more than 15%.

29part of Indo-g angetic plains of  India, dry or soaked wheat seeds can be sown a few days before or immediately 
after the harvest of the Rice crop under moist/ saturated soil conditions . This system of 'surface seeding' in 
wheat  is most suitable for  low land areas where the water received at a time advanced growth stage of wheat.  
The method , ideal for Rice – Wheat rotation,  controls weeds, conser ves resources and reduces cost of 
cultivation.  
7.7.3. Zer o- Tilla ge (ZT) T echnolo gy
Rice/Direct Seeded Rice (DSR)-W heat system is one of the major and dominant cropping systems that 
occupied appro ximately 11 million  hectares area in the Indo-Gang atic plains . To induce timely sowing of wheat  
within the range of optim um limit and to take advantag e of available soil moisture for initial stand 
establishment, sowing wheat  with the Zero Till  Ferti-cum-Seed Drill can be practiced.  The practice is picking 
up in the Indo-g angetic plains  but not recommended for heavy clay type soils. The technique can be adopted in 
Rice-W heat system in particular as a constituent of Conser vation Agriculture practices . 
7.7.4. Furrow Irrigated Raised Bed-Planting (FIRB) System
The FIRB method helps in saving irrigation water upto 40% and increase Nutrient Use Efficiency 
(NUE) and other inputs for economic crop production. Various versions of the machine suitable for sowing of 
wheat and other crops on raised beds have been developed by different groups working on FIRB system.   The 
method is also ideal for Rice – Wheat rotation for  reduced cost of cultivation owing to reduced of basic inputs 
like seeds , fertilizer to the tune of 25%, increased W ater Use Efficiency (WUE),  manag ement of  obno xious 
weeds like Phalaris minor and  ultimately resource conser vation.
7.7.5.   Rotary Tilla ge Technolo gy:
The Rotary Tillag e Machine is a combination of rotar y tiller, seed cum fertilizer drill and a light plank er 
cum driving wheel and is advantag eous over conventional tillage as the machine, completely pulverizes the soil, 
the seeding is done simultaneously , soil moisture is conser ved and saves energ y and time. The rotar y-till-drill  
machine named as DWR Rotavator-cum-Drill is suitable for sowing wheat both  under normal and late sown 
conditions and economizes on fuel and the all impor tant time especially when wheat  sowing is delayed after 
Rice harvest, particularly of Basmati type Rice. By this machine, sowing of wheat is completed in a single tractor 
operation leading to substantial savings on diesel consumption and time required for conventional field 
preparation.
7.8:  Weed mana gement:
7.8.1:  Impor tant Weed Flora:
The pre-dominant weeds are mostly annuals and  associated with wheat crop are Anag allis arvensis 
(Krishananeel), Argemone mexicana  (Satyanashi), Asphodelus tenuifolius  (Piazi), Avena ludoviciana  (Jangli Jai), Cannabis 
sativa (Bhang), Carthamus oxycantha  (Pohli), Chenopodium album  (Bathu), Cirsium arvense (Kateli), Convolvulus arvensis 
(Hirankhuri), Cornopus didymus (Pitpapra), Euphorbia jelioscopia (Dudhi), Fumaria parviflora  (Gajri), Lathyrus aphaca  
(Matri), Malva parviflora (Gogisag), Medicago denticulata (Maina), Malilotus alba (Metha), Phalaris 
minor (Mandushi/Gulidanda), Poa annua  (Poa ghas), Polygonum plebejum  (Raniphul), Polypogon monspeliensis  (Lomar 
ghas), Rumex retroflex (Jangli palak), Spergula arvensis (Bandhania), Vicia sativa (Chatri/Gegla).
Phalaris minor  is the dominant weed of wheat in rice-wheat system found in NWPZ. Sometimes its 
population is so high (2000-3000 plants / m2) that farmers are forced to harvest the wheat crop as fodder . 
30Isoproturon (Arelon) was recommended for the control of  Phalaris min or in 1980s . It remained effectiv e for 
almost a decade . But sole dependence on this herbicide resulted in the development of resistance to 
Isoproturon in controlling  Phalaris minor . In zero tillag e fields , the intensity of  Rumex and Malw a parviflora  is 
increasing and intending to become a problem in the coming years . Therefore , there is the requirement of strict  
vigilance regarding weed flora shift due to chang es in tillage practices .
7.8.2:  Weed Mana gement Practices
Various practices of weed manag ement can be grouped into three broad categ ories namely cultural and 
preventive; physical or mechanical; and chemical weed control. These practices are as under :
       7.8.2.1:  Cultural and Preventive
Cultural practices such as time and method of sowing, crop density and geometr y, crop varieties , dose, 
method and time of fertilizer application, time and method of irrigation have pronounced effect on crop-w eed 
interference . Some of these factors are use of  clean wheat seeds that is free from weed seeds , early sowing of 
wheat (before 15 Nov.), adoption of  closer row spacing (18 cm), adoption of  cris-cross sowing to increase 
population density of the wheat plants , placement of  basal dose of fertilizer 2-3 cm below the seed, sowing of 
wheat on Furrow Irrigated Raised Bed System (FIRBS) to reduce weed population, pulling  out weeds before 
seed setting for curbing seed bank of weeds, keeping  bunds & irrigation channels free from weeds, 
introduction of  either Berseem or Oat for Fodder , as a crop rotation and  sown once in three years , stimulate 
emerg ence of Phalaris by giving light irrigation followed by weed control with non-selecti ve herbicides like  
Glyphosate or cultivation followed by sowing of wheat, zero tillage offer a way to manag e Phalaris  and  grow 
fast growing and robust varieties of wheat for smothering impact on weeds.
7.8.2.2:  Mechanical Contr ol
Removal of weeds by various tools & implements including hand weeding . It is not feasible where 
weeds resemble morphologically to crop e.g. P. minor  & Avena ludoviciana  before flowering . Also, mechanical 
weed control becomes difficult in broadcast sown wheat. However, mechanical control can be practiced 
effecti vely when wheat is sown on FIRBS as this system facilitates tractor mounted implements usage.
7.8.2.3:  Chemical Contr ol
Chemical weed control is in practice because of less labour involvement and no mechanical damag e to 
the crop that happens during manual weeding hence cost effecti ve. Moreo ver, the control is more effecti ve as 
the weeds even within the rows are killed which invariably escape , because of morphological similarity to 
wheat, during mechanical control. The following Weedicides schedule has been found effecti ve in controlling 
the Isoproturon resistant population of Phalaris minor . Out of the four new herbicides found effecti ve against 
Phalaris , two namely Sulfosulfuran and Metribuzin w ere effecti ve against both grassy and non-g rassy w eeds, 
whereas Clodinafop and Fenoxaprop were specific to grassy weeds. The recommended herbicides for 
controlling different categ ories of weeds are as under :

327.9:  Plant protection:
               Incidence of diseases and pests  normally donot occur in wheat in severity except rusts. Rusts are the 
dreaded ones caused by fungal infestation. Among the three types of rusts in wheat, Stripe or Yellow rust and 
Stem or black rust, if allowed to contin ue uncontrolled  for few days, can cause 100% loss of wheat. The leaf or 
brown rust on the other hand, may cause 60% loss. Rusts along with other diseases occur in different locations 
of the countr y through survival in alternate hosts . The hotspot locations of different  diseases are as follows:
Table- 7.9: Identified Hotspot of Wheat Diseases
Rusts:  For the manag ement of Rusts, Crop health surveillance , apart from providing decision making 
tool for taking up the plant protection measures , also provides infor mation on the occurance and spread of the 
disease  in a locality and on the specific  culti var(s) with the pathotypes eme rged. Based on different modules 
formulated and validated at farmers' fields , the following package are recommended for manag ement of rusts 
particularly yellow rust in Northern India:

ØApplication of 0.1% solution of Tilt (Propiconazole 25EC) or Tebuconazole 250EC  @ 500 
ml/ha immediately after the appearance of any of the diseases i.e. Rust/foliar blight and 
powdery mildew . The spray should be at 15-20 days interval. Proph ylactic spray in the adjacent 
areas should also be done .
Karnal Bunt  : The disease caused by Tilletia indica, a basidiom yceteous fungal disease was first 
reported from  Karnal in Haryana in 1931.K arnal Bunt disease perpetuate year after year through seeds , soil 
and air borne inoculums .  Integ rated manag ement approac h is the ideal measure to manag e the disease . Under 
cultural approac h,  crop rotation, fallowing the land, non cultivation of wheat for more than 3 years which may 
extend till 7 years , adequate irrigation and balanced fertilizer application besides seed treatment  with with 
Carbo xin or Carbendazim @ 1.25 g/Kg of seed and Tricoder ma harzian um @ 2 g/ Kg of seed may be 
adopted. Spraying Propiconazole at heading stage, although does not eradicate the disease but  induces more 
than 71% control of Karnal Bunt. Some biocontrol agents like Trichoder ma viride, T.harzianum, T. lingorum, 
Gliocladium deliquscens etc. may control the disease .  Growing resistant varieties is the most effecti ve way in 
managing the disease . Over the years , number of  KB resistant varieties have been developed and released for 
cultivation . Prominent KB resistant varieties  recommended for cultivation in various zones are:
ØFor NHZ :  HS 420(2003), VL829(2002), VL892(2007), HS375(2003).
ØFor NWPZ: PBW 527( 2004), PDW314-d(2010), HD2687(1999), PBW  590(2008),

ØFor peninsular Zone(PZ) : UAS 428(2012).
Loose Smut:   The disease caused by Ustilag o tritici is one of the major diseases of wheat that occur in 
the NW PZ states . Treatment of  seeds with systemic fungicide viz.,  Carbo xin or Carbendazim (Bavistin) @ 
1.25 g/Kg of seed and Tricoder ma harzian um @ 2 g/ Kg of seed manag es the disease .
Insect-P ests incidence : Wheat crop in India is relati vely free from epidemics of insect-pests . 
However, incidence of Shoot fly, Brown wheat mite and Aphids are not uncommon. Termites have been a 
problem in some areas which can be controlled by seed treatment with Chloroph yriphos 20 EC @ 4 ml/Kg of 
seed in Termite infested area. 
 The IPM approac h would help in reduction in cost of production, more economic access of food to 
the poor and conser vation of the resilience and integ rity of ecosystems .
7.10:  Harvesting , threshing and stora ge
Fields should be total dry and harvesting should be done when  the ears are sufficiently dry and the grain 
moisture content is around 14 to 20%.  The  harvested crop is thereafter threshed and sundried to a moisture 
level of around 10-12%  for safe storag e.  Grains should be in galvanized beans and fumig ate it with alumin um  
34phosphide @ 01 tablet (3g of each) or EDB @ 3 ml/100 kg of grains. The crop is harvested in different periods 
in various zones/states . The zone wise harvesting period of wheat and threshing techniques adopted are as 
under :
35CROPPING 
SYSTEM8: CR OPPING SY STEM
8.1: Prevalent wheat cropping systems:
Wheat is grown mainly in cropping sequences like Rice-W heat, Jowar-Wheat, Bajra-W heat, 
Maize-W heat, Pulse-Wheat, Cotton-W heat, Soybean-W heat etc. in different parts of the countr y under 
irrigated condition although Rice-W heat system is the most common. Under rainfed condition, fallow-
Wheat is most common, but sometimes short duration pulse crops are also grown. Growing water 
guzzling crop of rice creates depletion of ground water thereb y reducing the availability for irrigation. 
Besides , non judicious and imbalanced application of fertilisers makes the system less sustainable .  The 
prevalent cropping systems in major wheat growing states are as under :
      T able-8.1:  Pr evalent cr opping system in volving wheat   in major W heat g rowing states
Ref. DES , DAC, MoA, Govt of  India, 2013
368.2: Pr eference of  farmers for rice-wheat croppin g system:
The western part (Punjab , Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh) of Rice-W heat belt of Indo-Gang etic 
Plains , where wheat is the predominant crop, provides a favourable environment through assured irrigation for 
both rice and wheat crops . The overall rice and wheat yields here are almost twice the yields obtained in the 
easter n states of Indo-Gang etic Plains . Wheat requires about 400 mm of water for irrigation to cater the need 
of the irrigation at all 6 critical growth stages. Availability of water for irrigation in these areas , mechanized 
farming including mechanized harvesting & threshing, longer shelf  life, assured procurement & minim um 
suppor t price and higher economic retur ns of the system are the main reasons for the farmers of NWPZ  to 
stick to the rice-wheat system. The easter n Indo gangetic plains of NEPZ have abundance of water for 
irrigation. .The popularity of the Rice – wheat system in the NEPZ states can also be attributed to most of the 
similar reasons as in NWPZ. However, the increasing trend of mechanization resulting in comparati vely lesser 
cost of cultivation, extending boundaries of assured procurement and higher MSP add to the reasons for the 
preference of the farmers. Madh ya Pradesh in the Central Zone is emerging as one of the main wheat growers 
of the countr y. Availability of provisions of more irrigations under restricted irrigation conditions and assured 
procurement and higher Minim um Suppor t Price with enhanced bonuses leading to higher economic retur ns of 
Rice-W heat system lured the farmers to incline towards the system.
  i. Depletion of Ground Water Resources:  Though ground water is a natural bounty with highest 
possible irrigation efficiency , whereas the development of surface water irrigation potential is a very 
costly affair entailing even the loss of producti ve land in networking of canals along with the 
associated problem of water logging, salinity , etc. North Western part of India (Haryana and 
Punjab) with Rice-W heat cropping system  is a typical example of such declining Ground water 
which is due to its overexploitation and brackish nature in some areas . 
 ii. Decline in Soil Fertility:  Simultaneous increase in nutrient mining and imbalanced fertilizers 
application are  damaging the soil fertility status so far as the quality of soil resources , environmental 
pollution and cost of production are concer ned. Out of 16 plant nutrients , C, H and O being 
contributed by air and water, rest 13 are taken up from soil. Presently , farmers apply nitrog en, 
phosphor us and zinc (in some cases) only i.e. for other 10 nutrients there is no replenishment 
towards soil bank. The status of potash and various micron utrients is declining  and may not be  
sufficient to meet the requirement of the crop in near future due to their lack of replenishment. The existing buffer stock norm of Govt of India  indicates the requirement of 11.2 million tonnes of 
st
wheat as on 1 January every year. Wheat constituted   little more than 50% of the stock of foodg arins (34.38 
st
million tonnes) in the central pool as on 1 January of the current year (Ref. Agri statistics at a glance , 2013, Govt 
of India). As such surplus wheat is available in the national food basket signifying the contribution of the 
farmers growing wheat. 
8.3:  Problem in prevalent cropping system:  
While considering the sustainability of Rice-W heat Cropping System (RWCS) of the countr y, it has 
been obser ved that the  rice and wheat yields are either stagnant or yet to reach their potential.  Swaminanthan 
(2002) indicated that Punjab , Haryana Western Uttar Pradesh regions (a major part of RWCS belt of India), 
which today serve as India's food basket, may become very food insecure in another 20 years . As such there is 
wide concer n about the sustainability of this system. Some of the impor tant issues are :
37 of North-W est India, soil carbon has decreased from 0.05 in 1960's 
to 0.02% in the late 1990's . Such a decline is prevalent throughout the RWCS in India. There is 
perce ptible decrease in the efficiency of chemical fertilizers as such.
     iii.Decline in Factor Producti vity:  While  yields are stagnating and even declining or unable to reach the 
potential status in certain cases , input use patter n reflects progressive increase in nutrient demand, more 
application of pesticides and also strain on water front. This implies that input use efficiency is 
decreasing with simultaneous increase in cost of production. The higher cost of production in any crop 
increases the risk probabilities . The net income from Rice-W heat Cropping System  is declining and 
farmers are finding hard to maintain their per unit economic retur ns . Reduction in cost of production 
through various means viz., operational costs involving land preparation, mechanization in sowing, 
intercultural and harvesting/threshing including Resource conser vation Technologies in Conser vation 
Agriculture practices  may augment the farmers income out of their crop fields .
 circumstances farmers tend to act on the 
advice of dealers , are adding complexity to the situation. This situation is further deteriorated by 
monoculture .  Some of impor tant issues are
ØIncidence of Rusts (Stripe rust) has been growing a major concer n & occurs only in the peak 
growing season of the crop. Massi ve awareness and spray operations of Propiconazole  including 
growing resistant varieties of wheat answ ers the threat. Spraying of Propiconazole and Tebuconazole in 
alternate seasons are also recommended to  escape any build up of resistance . 
ØKarnal Bunt  is another problem  that comes on the way of achieving higher producti vity and  
mark eting. Resistant varieties have been  developed but the wheat fields where the disease occur red  
have been suggested to be kept out of wheat cultivation at least for three years and simultaneously soil 
and seed treatment need to be carried out even in other nearb y areas .  
       v.Problem of weeds and their mana gement: Weed is one of the major biotic constraints in wheat  
production as they compete for nutrients ,moisture , light and space .  Weeds are associated with specific 
crops and the most critical stage of crop-w eed competition remains within 30-35 days after sowing. 
Impro ved cultural practices led to build up of the difficult weed Phalaris minor .
Ø  Phalaris minor  is one of the threats  in wheat production. The obno xious weed  was found to have 
built up resistance to the most effecti ve weedicide- isoproturon. Application of other herbicides 
viz.,  Sulfosulfuron  or Leader ,  Clodinafop , Pinoxaden and  fenoxaprop have been the most 
effecti ve measure to contain the grassy weed to grow.
Ø  Integ rated Weed Manag ement  combines nos of effecti ve weed control measures which involves 
maintaining the optim um plant density , maintaining optim um time of sowing, proper spacing,  
adequate recommended fertilizer and irrigation water manag ement in combination with chemical  
methods i.e. application of herbicides leads to effecti ve manag ement of weed species thus 
prevents any weed shift flora.  
8.4:  Suggested alter nate cropping system:
In Rice-W heat Cropping System (RWCS) much of the problem relates to rice and it is the most 
remunerati ve crop in the kharif  season with probably no alternative at present. Apar t from the core districts are In the major rice-wheat system areas
       iv.Rising Problem of Insect-pest and Disease Complex:  The lush green crops of rice and wheat  
with liberal use of nitrog enous fertilizers and constant favourable  condition becomes a paradise for  
building up an insect-pest and disease complex. Under the
38tempting to grow rice under sub-optimal conditions which is more damaging to the quality of natural resources . Delay in 
harvest of rice further delays sowing of wheat that results in yield reduction.  While retaining rice in Kharif  season, early 
varieties maturing in 95-105 days after transplanting will facilitate diversification within the RWCS as replacement of 
wheat  with  crops including short duration ones  (mustard-summer moong, pea-potato , toria-sunf lower, potato-
sunflower, toria-potato , potato-onion, pea-cucurbits , raya-cucurbits , etc.). The alternative crop sequences with pulses and 
oilseeds will save the resources and may be equally profitable as well as soil fertility impro vement. In case where rice is yet 
to be kept in the cropping system as inevitable introduction of direct seeded rice( DSR) may be the ultimate option to 
arrest the resource depletion.
Intercropping wheat in sugarcane is another viable option. Sugarcane alone is a remunerati ve crop and also there 
is enough scope of  addition of  wheat  through intercropping . Gro wing wheat after sug arcane also existed in areas lik e 
Western UP and is also a profitable cropping system.  The  system  is therefore  found to create yield enhancement of 
wheat  and ultimately enhance the total income of the farmers. 
8.5:  Means to stabilize and sustain the rice-wheat cropping system:
There has been depletion of  natural resources  in RWCS and also  in reversible limits thus sustainability of the 
system is in question.  The necessar y   measures are therefore need to be taken to stabilize the system. Some of the 
measures are as under :
      a.Zero Tilla ge: Zero tillage as breakthrough in wheat cultivation. The  long duration  rice cultivation before wheat 
usually overlaps the following wheat season thereb y induces delayed sowing of wheat.  Zero tillage  reduces the 
time taken for land preparation besides economizing  the cost of production resulting in increasing the margin 
of profit for the wheat growers. Additionally , wed infestation is also reduced in zero tillage areas . 
b.Green Manuring: There is a fallow period of  45-50 days betw een har vest of  wheat an d transplanting of rice 
which is sufficient to raise a very good green manure crop. Though any leguminous crop can be used for green 
-1
manuring but Sesbania aculeata is best fit. It grows well even on marginal soils, could accum ulate about 250 q ha 
-1
biomass in seven weeks. Its incor poration in the soil can contribute 60-80 kg N ha. The carbon and nitrog en ratio 
is ideal for rapid decomposition and nitrog en availability is as fast as from urea. Green manuring alone is sufficient 
to meet all the nitrog en need of Basmati  rice, whereas in other varieties it is possible to skip the basal dose. 
c.Crop Residue Mana gement: Due to short turn-around period between two crops in RWCS, crop residue 
manag ement is a serious problem. Wheat residue manag ement becomes a problem if a third crop (rice/ 
moonbeam/co wpea/fodder) is taken during summer . Since it is very crucial to sustain the RWCS and in 
conser vation tillage it is worth to retain 30% of the crop residues . 
d.Integ rated Pest  and disease Mana gement (IPM): I Wheat is comparati vely a safe crop as far as pest 
incidence is concer ned  
e.Judicious Water Mana gement: Water-Use-Efficiency in Rice-Wheat Cropping System (RWCS) is generally 
low. Water manag ement in RWCS can be optimized by appropriate soil manag ement to reduce percolation, 
proper scheduling of irrigation, use of ground water and utilization of rain water. Thus, proper use of water 
resource may enhance the water producti vity.

SYSTEMS
10.1:  Brief  description of impor tant Crop Development programmes involving Wheat crop:
        With a view to supplement the effor ts of the State Departments of Agriculture in increasing the 
production and producti vity status of wheat, the Ministr y of Agriculture , Govt. of India are implementing 
following crop development programmes:
10.1.1: National F ood Security Mission (NFSM):
In view of the resolution adopted by the National Development Council (NDC), a Centrally 
Sponsored Scheme of 'National Food Security Mission' was   launc hed from Rabi, 2007-08  in the countr y to 
enhance the production of additional 20 million tonnes of food grains. Out  of this, an  additional  production 
of wheat was targeted to be  8  million tonnes by the end of XI Plan through implementation of the  
component  NFSM-W heat during XI Plan period. 
During 12th Five Year Plan, the National Food Security Mission is contin ued to be implemented in  the 
same 27 states of the countr y  with a target of additional  production  of 25 million tons of food grains. 
th
NFSM-W heat, one of the five components of NFSM during the 12 plan is  under implementation in 125  
identified districts of 11(elev en) states  viz, Bihar , Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab , Uttar Pradesh, Himac hal Pradesh, 
Jamm u & Kashmir , Madh ya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand with the  target of additional 
production of 8 million tonnes of wheat.
 The main interventions of the mission are Need based inputs with proven technolog y (Seeds of 
impro ved varieties , Nutrients like Fe and Zn, Soil Ameliorants like Gypsum etc., Bio- fertilizers viz., 
Azotobacter etc., Plant Protection chemicals), Farm Machineries & implements viz., sprayers, pumpsets , 
rotavators etc., Water efficient tools and capacity building of farmers. A cafeteria of crop specific interventions 
(bio-fer tilizers , nutrients , plant protection chemicals , weedicides etc.) has been inducted to enable the states to 
choose interventions relevant to that particular Agro-climatic zone for demonstrations . A cafeteria of crop 
specific interventions (biofer tilisers , nutrients , plant protection chemicals , weedicides etc) has been inducted to 
enable the states to choose interventions relevant to the particular agro-climatic zone for demonstration of 
impro ved crop production technologies .
 The aim of the Mission was to increase production of rice, wheat and pulses through area expansion 
and producti vity enhancement; restoring soil fertility and producti vity; creating emplo yment oppor tunities; 
and enhancing farm level econom y to restore confidence of farmers of targeted districts . 
4410.1.2.  Bringing Green Revolution to Easter n India (BGREI):   
The program of  “Bringing Green Revolution to Easter n India (BGREI)” was launc hed in 2010-11 to 
address the constraints limiting the producti vity of “Rice Based Cropping Systems” the aim of the BGREI is to 
harness the water potential for enhancing agriculture production in easter n India comprising seven States 
namely;  Assam,  Bihar ,  Chhattisg arh,  Jharkhand,  Odisha,  Easter n  Uttar Pradesh (Purvanchal) and West 
Beng al. The main objecti ves of the programme are : Yield maximization of rice and wheat per unit area by 
impro ving agronom y; water harvesting and conser vation; water utilization. The  programme  was extended   
till the terminal period of  XI plan period and is also expected to be contin ued  further on year to year basis  as a 
sub-prog ramme under RKVY .
 BGREI comprised three broad categ ories of interventions: (i) block demonstrations; (ii) asset building 
activities such as constr uction of check dams , minor irrigation tanks and other water resources development 
works; and (iii) site specific activities for facilitating petty works such as constr uction/reno vation of irrigation 
channels/electricity for agricultural purposes in a cluster approac h for convenience and cost effecti veness 
and(i v) mark et suppor t. BGREI promoted adoption of new seed varieties , farm machines , nutrients , pesticides 
and knowledg e based intervention as developed for different agro-climatic zones of easter n India. 
 The allocation of funds as  made during the  year (2013-14)  was (i)Demonstrations in Clusters(50% of 
State allocation), (ii) Asset Building(20% allocation), (iii) Site Specific Activities (20%  allocation) and (iv) 
Mark eting Suppor t (10% allocation). The programme is also being contin ued during 2014-15 in all the seven 
states of easter n India (Assam, Easter n Uttar Pradesh, Bihar , Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisg arh and west 
Beng al). Wheat crop is also embraced in the programme . Altog ether 29 districts (13 districts in Bihar , 1 district 
in Easter n Uttar Pradesh and 15 districts in west Beng al) are included in the programme and identified as wheat 
districts under  the programme also targeting  wheat crop based implementation.  
10.1.3:  National Mission on Sustaina ble Ag ricultur e (NMSA):
 NMSA was launc hed during 2014 and has four major programme components e.g. 'Rainfed 
Area Development', 'Soil Health Manag ement', ‘On Farm Water Manag ement' and 'Climate Chang e and 
Sustainable Agriculture Modelling and Netw orking'. NMSA  also  targets the states in which the major wheat 
growing states are also included with the provision of above components .  The programme covers all districts 
of  all states of the countr y, hence , all the wheat growing states are automatically covered under the 
programme . Therefore , consideration of the programme in mitig ating impact of climate chang e in wheat crop 
in a system is of impor tance once the programme reveals its outcome . Provision for assistance in the form of 
input upto 50% of  the cost limited to Rs .10,000/- per ha  for wheat based cropping systems under the sub-
component of Integ rated Farming System of Rainfed Area Development(RAD) has been made . Besides ,  
assistance for Resource Conser vation, vermi-compost, reclamation of problem soils(alkaline), constr uction of 
borew ells/rec harge of defunct w ells/acti vation of  water lifting devices  and for mation of  Farmer Producer 
Organisations (FPOs) and their trainings in wheat g rowing states are also being pro vided under the mission.  
45On-far m water manag ement with provision of  assistance under micro irrigation including drip irrigation,  and 
sprinklers with drainag e systems are also included in the mission which is also operational in wheat growing 
states .  
10.1.4: National Mission on Agricultur e Extension and Technolo gy (NMAET):
The NMAET has been envisag ed as the next step towards this objecti ve through the amalg amation of 
these schemes . The Mission Document has been prepared in keeping with the recommendations of the 
Working Group of the Planning Commission and suggestions and inputs received from extensi ve consultation 
with stakeholders , particularly farmers. The common threads running across all 4 Sub-Missions in NMAET are 
Extension and Technolog y. These sub-missions are (i) Sub Mission on Agricultural Extension (SMAE), (ii) Sub 
Mission on Seed Production(SMSP), (iii) Sub mission on Agricultural Mechanisation (SMAM) and (iv) Sub 
mission on Plant Protection (SMPP). The aim of the Mission is to restructure and strengthen agricultural 
extension to enable delivery of appropriate technolog y and impro ved agronomic practices to farmers. The 
major wheat growing states of the countr y are also covered under the programme . The strategies of these 
mission activities  are interacti ve methods of infor mation dissemination, use of Infor mation & 
Comm unication Technolog y (ICT), popularisation of moder n and appropriate technologies , capacity building 
and institution strengthening to promote mechanisation, availability of quality seeds , plant protection etc. and 
encourag e aggregation of Farmers into Farmers Interest Groups (FIGs) to form Farmer Producer 
Organisations (FPOs). The seed villag e programme under Sub-Mission for Seed and Planting Material (SMSP)  
is dedicated for production of seeds to be certified  and to be made available in a state or locality .  The major 
wheat growing states have also been brought under these submissions .  
10.1.5: Rashtriy a Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY):
One of the basic objecti ves of RKVY is to incenti vize investments in agriculture and allied sectors by 
linking state wise allocation of RKVY funds to the increased share of State plan expenditure in agriculture and 
allied sectors . This has helped in stepping up allocation to crops & priorities , reducing yield gaps, maximisation 
of farmers retur ns and bringing quantifiable chang es in production and producti vity. Under this programme , 
for the stream RKVY (Production growth) the major wheat growing states viz., Bihar , Gujarat,  Haryana,  
Punjab ,  Uttar Pradesh,  Madh ya Pradesh, Jharkhand,  Chhattisg arh,  Karnataka,  Uttarakhand, West Beng al,  
Himac hal Pradesh,  Jamm u & Kashmir and Rajasthan have been taking up programmes on integ rated 
development of wheat crop also. Under this programme , the interventions adopted were broadly for provision 
for  purchase of breeders and certified seeds by farmers, production  of foundation and certified seeds , seed 
treatment, FFS at demonstration sites besides other provisions like pest manag ement, mechanisation, farmers 
study tour etc pertaining to wheat growers.  
4610.1.6.  Gramin Bhandaran Yojana :
Government of India initiated a Rural Godo wn Scheme ( Gramin Bhandaran Yojna) in  collaboration 
with NAB ARD and National Cooperati ve Development Corporation (NCDC)  to constr uct Rural Godo wns 
in order to facilitate storag e facilities at the farm gate level. The produce is stored by a scientific method so that 
the wastag e and deterioration of grain are avoided or reduced to a minim um. The constr uction of  godowns are 
sanctioned through NAB ARD and NCDC with the total capacity upto the desired levels which includes 
constr uction, renovation and expansion of existing godowns. The main objecti ves of the Rural Godo wn 
Scheme are as under : 
To prevent distress sale of food grains and other agricultural produce immediately after harvest.
To reduce quantitati ve and qualitati ve losses due to storing of food grains in substandard 
storag e.
To reduce pressure on transpor t system in the post harvest periods of peak supply .
To help the farmers in getting pledg e loans against their stored produce to meet immediate 
financial requirement.?

THE 
CUL TIVATION 
OF WHEAT11.2: Agency wise quantities of  crop pr ocur ement during last ten y ears in the states:
            To facilitate procurement of food grains, FCI) and various State Agencies 
in consultation with the State Govt. establish a large number of purchase centres . 
Food Cor poration of  India (FCI), the nodal central agency of  GOI, along with other St ate Ag encies 
under takes procurement of wheat.  Procurement under Price Suppor t is taken up mainly to ensure 
remunerati ve prices to the farmers for their produce which results into higher production and producti vity. 
Before the harvest during each Rabi / Kharif  Crop season, the Govt. of India announces the minim um suppor t 
prices (MSP) for procurement on the basis of the recommendation of the Commission for Agricultural Costs 
and Prices (CACP).  State-wise procurement of wheat from 1991-92 to 2013-14 ( Annexur e XII )indicated that 
wheat still occupies a significant position in procurement status and  the year 2012-13 could record the highest 
ever record procurement in prime states viz, Punjab , Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. In the following years , 
although Uttar Pradesh showed a decline in procurement, the total procurement of wheat  for the entire 
countr y during 2013-14 maintained the level of 250 plus lakh tones .  The buffer  stock norms wheat  of  st
Government of India indicates that the buffer stock is required to be maintained at 11.2 million tones as on 1 
January. The central pool stock of 34.38 million tones was about 35% more than that of previous year.  This 
status of stock of 34.38 million tonnes in the central pool  during 2013  indicated that the stock is 3 times more 
than the buffer hence surplus availability of wheat in the national food grains basket. The procurement status 
Such a surplus wheat is reflected to the higher procurement in the central pool which may  be attributed to the 
higher remunerati ve suppor t price level of wheat. Food Corporation of India (

4811.3.  Prevalent Marketing Channels of Wheat : 
Mark eting channel is a route through which the produce from the farm reaches to the ultimate 
consumer .  The most common  channels for mark eting of  wheat for  consumption are:
1. Farmer     ð     Consumer
2. Farmer     ðVillage Trader  ð Consumer
3. Farmer     ðWholesaler  ð Retailer  ð Consumer 
4.  Farmer    ðVillage Trader  ð Wholesaler  ð Retailer  ð  Consumer 
5. Farmer    ðWholesaler   ð Miller   ð Retailer  ð Consumer
               Food Corporation of India (FCI) is the main agency for procurement, maintenance of buffer stock 
and distribution of wheat. The main institutional mark eting channels for wheat are as under :
1.Farmer  ð  (FCI, State Go vt. Co-operati ves) Go vt. Agency  ð Fair Price Shop  ð Consumer
2.Farmer  ð  Co-operati ve Marketing Society  ð   Retailer  ð   Consumer
3.Farmer  ð (FCI,  State Govt. Co-operati ves)  ð  Private Trader  ð   Expor t. 
 
 The total costs or the mark eting costs incur red by the producer – seller and by the various intermediaries 
involved in the sale and purchase of the produce till the commodity reaches the ultimate consumer  include 
initial handling charges, assembling charges, storag e and transpor t cost, handling charges by wholesaler and 
retailer besides other expenses on secondar y services. Such mark et costs can be reduced by increasing the 
efficiencies of various mark et interventions .
Food Corporation of India (FCI) issues unifor m specifications of procurement which is updated from 
time to time in a need based manner .  The latest such specifications issued by them are normal mature dried 
clean grains with normal size, shape , colour and luster free from obno xious smell, free from admixture of toxic 
and weed seeds like Argemone Mexicana and Lathyrus in any form besides under the control of Food safety and 
standards act of Govt of India and in a merc hantable condition.  The agency further specifies mandator y 
clauses like grains presented for procurement  should be within the moisture content of 12 to 14%, within the 
overall limit of any foreign matter , within the limit of damag ed grains or ergot infestation ( limit 0.05  %). In 
cases of stocks having living infestation including weevil (maxim um limit1%), there will be a cut of Rs.2/- per 
quintal charged as fumig ation charges.  The permissible limits of different refractions in Fair Average Quality of 
wheat grains for procurement  are  0.75% foreign matter , 2% each of other food grains & damag ed grains, 4% 
slightly damag ed grains and 6% shriveled  and broken grains.

Mark et Arrivals of wheat during the past decades   indicated that the steepest increase in arrivals was in 
the state of Madh ya Pradesh although the highest quantity was recorded in the state of Punjab followed by 
Madh ya Pradesh and Haryana due to higher production reaped during the recent years . 
Among the major wheat growing states the  arrivals recorded steep increase for the state of Punjab 
followed by Har yana and Madh ya Pradesh. Although Punjab contin ued to be at the top of the procurement 
status during 2012-13, but the trend was reversed with the realistic status that, Madh ya Pradesh surpassed the 
procurement status during 2013-14 followed by Punjab and Haryana. Thus it may be concluded that among the 
major wheat growing states , the leading contributors were Madh ya Pradesh , Punjab and Haryana due to their th
higher production reaped. The State-wise mark et arrival of Wheat during the years of the 11 Plan periods and 
during 2012-13 and 2013-14 are given at (Annexur e XIV)

trading across the globe in various countries .  The impor tant wheat trading centres in some major wheat 
growing countries are as follows:
5111.8.: Stora ge of harvested Wheat grains:
Wheat is main staple food for majority population, hence stored from one season to the other.  Safe storage 
facilitates better price realization (+ 25 per cent) by extending marketing duration. There are many factors influencing 
storage loss in wheat which are moisture, temperature, insects, rodents, quality status before storage, types of storage  
bin/containers, sanitation, use of fumigants/pesticides, type of damage before storing the grain (like fress and webbing, 
exit holes, darkened kernels and damaged kernels), mechanical factors and other general conditions like location of 
storage etc.
 Harvested grains normally contain 20 per cent moisture . For safe storage, maintenance of around 12-14 per 
cent grain moisture content is recommended. Higher moisture content resulted in musty odour, discolouration and lower flour 
yield. It is therefore necessary that an equilibrium moisture content for wheat around  13 per cent at 70 per cent RH (Relative 
Humidity) be maintained.  For longer duration storage rolling in to  years, the grain moisture  should be 11 to 12 per 
cent coupled with suitable treatment for stored grain pests & diseases.
  Indian farmers retain more than 50  per cent of their harvested  grains  for human consumption, cattle feed, 
seed, etc. Grains are generally stored in simple granaries constructed from locally available materials like paddy straw, 
split bamboo, reeds, mud and bricks. However, improper storage leads to damage  due to factors like birds, rodents, 
insects like weevil, beetles and moth and fungus infestation. The various measures to protect the stored grain wheat are:
Prophylactic measur es: Spraying Malathion 50EC (1 litre in 100 litres of water) in every 15 days; 
spraying DDVP 76 EC (1 litre in 150 litres of water) on walls & floors when required; Spraying Deltamethrin2.5 
WP (1 kg in 25 litres of water)on walls and floors .
Curati ve Treatments : Use of chemicals like Aluminium phosphide @ 2-3 tablets per tonne in  
covered stocks controls infestation. For rodents , rat cage, use of bails with coagulants or rat burrow fumig ation  
by aluminium phosphide are effecti ve. 
Preventive Measures: At farm level may be dry (12-14% moisture),clean and grains with good 
appearance which prevents the insect-pests and fungus etc to build up. Recommended chemicals in prescribed 
dosage has to be applied.   
11.9: Provisions for credit:
             11.9.1:  Provisions for Agricultural Credit: 
Bank credit is available to the farmers in the form of short-term credit for purchasing consumable 
inputs  and in the form of  medium-ter m/long–ter m credit for financing capital investment in agriculture 
andallied activities . Loans are also available for storag e, processing and mark eting of agricultural produce .

 11.10: Crop insurance.
 Agriculture in India  is highly susce ptible to risks like droughts and floods . 
The National Crop Insurance Scheme (NCIS) or the Rashtriya Fasal Bima Karyakram  has  the 
objecti ve of providing insurance coverage to far mers in t he ev ent of   failure of notified cr ops, to encour age 
farmers to adopt impro ved package and to help stabilize income of farmers in disaster years . The programme 
has  the components such as  the Modified National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (MNAIS) and the Weather 
based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS) and are also under implementation in the major wheat growing states 
viz., Bihar , Chhattisg arh,  Gujarat, Haryana, Himac hal Pradesh, Madh ya Pradesh, Jamm u & Kashmir , 
Jharkhand,  Karnataka,  Maharashtra, Punjab , Rajasthan,  Uttar Pradesh,  West Beng al . 
   Wheat, among the cereals is also covered under the programme . Ten years historical data is considered 
adequate for setting premium rates, fixing indemnity limit and threshold yield of the concer ned crop.
All farmers of wheat growing states including the individual farmers/sharecroppers/tenant farmers/ 
contract farmers/g roup of farmers engaged by Non-Go vernment Organisations (NGOs)/Self  Help Grouprs 
(SHGs) etc are covered under the programme . The sum Insured would be at least equal to the amount of crop 
loan sanctioned/adv anced, which may extend up to the value of the threshold yield of the insured crop at the 
option of  the insured farmers.
     The premium rates are worked out on actuarial basis. The premium required to be paid by the 
farmers is subsidised  as follows:
Premium    
   slab    payable by farmers
Upto 2%                               NIL
>2-5%     40% subject to minimum net premium of 2%
>5-10%     50% subject to minimum net premium of 3%
>10-15%     60% subject to minimum net premium of 5%
>15%     75% subject to minimum net premium of 6%Subsidy by central and state Govt on 50:50 basis and premiumTable- 1 1.5: Premium slab and Subsidy on Premium
However, the premium rates is capped at 9% of the sum assured in case of wheat being the rabi annual crop. 
The scheme operates on “Area Approac h” i.e., defined areas for damag e by widespread calamities . For 
localized risks, like hailstor ms, landslides , the claims will be on individual basis and for all others , there will be the 
area approac h.
Under the second categ ory of Weather Based Crop Insurance Schemen(WBCIS), the financial loss es 
out of weather aberrations like drought/deficit rainfall, flood/ex cess rainfall, heat(temperature), frost etc.
